== The manifest

This is the list of all modules including short descriptions.

=== Main

crm::

	The program. Not much here.

modules/main.py::

	Start, verify environment, compatibility with various
	software versions, read and parse options, load user
	preferences, parse user's input (lexer is shlex).

modules/levels.py::

	Levels (collections of commands) hierarchy. Takes care of the
	prompt and moving back and forth through levels.

=== User interface

modules/ui.py::

	User interface. All levels and commands are implemented here.
	The starting point is the +TopLevel+ class (the root level).
	For instance, other +UserInterface+ subclasses include
	+RscMgmt+, +RA+, and +CibConfig+. The code should be mostly
	straightforward.

modules/completion.py::

	Tab completion for interactive use. The list of all
	completers is in the +completer_lists+ dictionary. It is used
	by +Levels+ to create a completion table. Can show parts of
	the RA metadata or other help texts. Quite convoluted at some
	spots and otherwise trivial.

modules/help.py::

	Reads help from a text file and presents parts of it in
	response to the help command. The text file has special
	anchors to demarcate help topics and command help text. See
	the +HelpSystem+ class for more information.

doc/crm.8.txt::

	Online help in asciidoc format. Several help topics (search
	for +[[topic_+) and command reference (search for
	+[[cmdhelp_+). Every user interface change needs to be
	reflected here. _Actually, every user interface change has to
	start here_. A source for the +crm(8)+ man page too.

=== Global variables

modules/config.py.in::

    Compile-time constants defined during the build process.

modules/vars.py::

	Global constants (mostly) and (a few) variables (it would be
	good to separate the two).

modules/userprefs.py::

	User preferences. Keeps also user options passed on the
	command line.

=== CIB configuration editing and management

modules/cibconfig.py::

	Configuration (CIB) manager. Implements the configure level.
	The bigest and the most complex part. There are three major
	classes:

	+CibFactory+::: operations on the CIB or parts of it.

	+CibObject+::: every CIB element is implemented in a
	subclass of +CibObject+. The configuration consists of a
	set of +CibObject+ instances (subclassed, e.g. +CibNode+ or
	+CibPrimitive+).

	+CibObjectSet+::: enables operations on sets of CIB
	elements. Two subclasses with CLI and XML presentations
	of cib elements. Most operations are going via these
	subclasses (+show+, +edit+, +save+, +filter+).

modules/idmgmt.py::

	CIB id management. Guarantees that all ids are unique.
	A helper for CibFactory.

modules/parse.py::

	CIB elements CLI parser.

modules/cliformat.py::

	A set of functions to format CIB elements (XML -> CLI
	converter).

modules/clidisplay.py::

	Embelishment class for the terminal.

modules/crm_gv.py::

	Interface to GraphViz. Generates graph specs for dotty(1).

=== CIB status editing

modules/cibstatus.py::

	CIB status section editor and manipulator (cibstatus
	level). Interface to crm_simulate.

=== Resource agents

modules/ra.py::

	Resource agents interface.

modules/rsctest.py::

	Resource tester (configure rsctest command).

=== Cluster history

modules/report.py::

	Cluster history. Interface to logs and other artifacts left
	on disk by the cluster.

modules/log_patterns.py, log_patterns_118.py::

	Pacemaker subsystems' log patterns. For versions earlier than
	1.1.8 and the latter.

=== Auxiliary

modules/singletonmixin.py::

	Implementation of the singleton pattern (from activestate).
	Enables single instance use across several modules. Heavily
	(ab)used.

modules/term.py::

	Terminal driver (from activestate).

modules/schema.py, pacemaker.py::

	Support for pacemaker RNG schema.

modules/cache.py::
	A very rudimentary cache implementation. Used to cache
	results of expensive operations (i.e. ra meta).

modules/crm_pssh.py::

	Interface to pssh (parallel ssh).

modules/msg.py::

	Messages for users. Can count lines and include line
	numbers. Needs refinement.

modules/utils.py::

	A bag of useful functions. Needs more order.

modules/xmlutil.py::

	A bag of useful XML functions. Needs more order.

== Code improvements

These are some thoughts on how to improve maintainability and
make crmsh nicer. Mostly for people looking at the code, the
users shouldn't notice much (or any) difference.

Everybody's invited to comment and make further suggestions, in
particular experienced pythonistas.

=== Parser

	- the current parser is just awful

	- the parser should be implemented in one of the existing
	  python parsing libraries/tools, such as PLY or pyparsing
	  (need to investigate which would be the easiest to apply
	  for the crmsh language)

	- proper parser should allow easier updates and easier
	  language extension (currently, crmsh doesn't support
	  some date rule constructs)

	- make sure that the new parser is not significantly slower
	  from the existing!

=== Syntax highlighting

	- syntax highlighting is done before producing output, which
	  is basically wrong and makes code convoluted; it further
	  makes extra processing more difficult

	- use a python library (pygments seems to be the best
	  candidate); that should also allow other output formats
	  (not only terminal)

	- how to extend pygments to understand a new language? it'd
	  be good to be able to get this _without_ pushing the parser
	  upstream (that would take _long_ to propagate to
	  distributions)

=== Language class

	- the crmsh language is packed just as a list of lists of
	  lists or thereabouts, which is not very convenient (in
	  particular for debugging); it actually used to be a dict,
	  then dicts wouldn't do as they don't guarantee order and I
	  didn't know at the time about ordered dictionaries

	- a class to capture the language should help

=== Configuration edit is complex

	- at the time it didn't seem like anything less would do, but
	  it's worth revising
	  (done in changeset 12acfbfe94c6)

=== XML production is ugly

	- due in part to preserving all XML ids (which may not be
	  necessary, but makes comparing XMLs for equality easier)

	- some kind of production rules set and a general XML machine
	  would be preferable

=== CibFactory is huge

	- this is a single central CIB class, it'd be good to have it
	  split into several smaller classes (how?)

=== The element create/update procedure is complex

	- not sure how to improve this

=== Bad namespace separation

	- xmlutil and utils are just a loose collection of functions,
	  need to be organized better (get rid of 'from xyz import *')

=== Add more comments

	- in particular describe how CibObjectSet, CibObject, and
	  CibFactory work together (that's the core of the configure
	  level)

=== Fix incorrect use of CibFactory.is_cib_sane()

    - This function should only be used internally in CibFactory, and
      should be called from every entry point into the class: It
      handles lazy initialization of the cib. Right now it is used
      from ui.py as well. Also, the error handling if it fails
      needs to be cleaned up.
