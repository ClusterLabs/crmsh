# crmsh

crmsh is a command-line interface for High-Availability cluster
management on GNU/Linux systems, and part of the Clusterlabs
project. It simplifies the configuration, management and
troubleshooting of Pacemaker-based clusters, by providing a powerful
and intuitive set of features.

crmsh can function both as an interactive shell with tab completion
and inline documentation, and as a command-line tool. It can also be
used in batch mode to execute commands from files.
