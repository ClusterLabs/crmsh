Example stateless resource agent (ocf:pacemaker:Dummy)

This is a dummy OCF resource agent. It does absolutely nothing except keep track
of whether it is running or not, and can be configured so that actions fail or
take a long time. Its purpose is primarily for testing, and to serve as a
template for resource agent writers.

Parameters (*: required, []: default):

state (string, [state-file]): State file
    Location to store the resource state in.

passwd (string): Password
    Fake password field

fake (string, [dummy]): 
    Fake attribute that can be changed to cause an agent reload

op_sleep (string, [0]): Operation sleep duration in seconds.
    Number of seconds to sleep during operations.  This can be used to test how
    the cluster reacts to operation timeouts.

fail_start_on (string): Report bogus start failure on specified host
    Start, migrate_from, and reload-agent actions will return failure if running on
    the host specified here, but the resource will run successfully anyway (future
    monitor calls will find it running). This can be used to test on-fail=ignore.

envfile (string): Environment dump file
    If this is set, the environment will be dumped to this file for every call.

Operations' defaults (advisory minimum):

    start         timeout=20s
    stop          timeout=20s
    monitor       timeout=20s interval=10s depth=0
    reload        timeout=20s
    reload-agent  timeout=20s
    migrate_to    timeout=20s
    migrate_from  timeout=20s

ssh STONITH device (stonith:external/ssh)

ssh-based host reset
Fine for testing, but not suitable for production!
Only reboot action supported, no poweroff, and, surprisingly enough, no poweron.

Parameters (*: required, []: default):

hostlist* (string): Hostlist
    The list of hosts that the STONITH device controls

livedangerously (enum): Live Dangerously!!
    Set to "yes" if you want to risk your system's integrity.
    Of course, since this plugin isn't for production, using it
    in production at all is a bad idea.  On the other hand,
    setting this parameter to yes makes it an even worse idea.
    Viva la Vida Loca!

pcmk_host_argument (string, [port]): *** Advanced Use Only *** An alternate parameter to supply instead of 'port'
    Some devices do not support the standard 'port' parameter or may provide additional ones. Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, parameter that should indicate the machine to be fenced. A value of "none" can be used to tell the cluster not to supply any additional parameters.

pcmk_host_map (string): A mapping of node names to port numbers for devices that do not support node names.
    For example, "node1:1;node2:2,3" would tell the cluster to use port 1 for node1 and ports 2 and 3 for node2.

pcmk_host_list (string): Nodes targeted by this device
    Comma-separated list of nodes that can be targeted by this device (for example, "node1,node2,node3"). If pcmk_host_check is "static-list", either this or pcmk_host_map must be set.

pcmk_host_check (select): How to determine which nodes can be targeted by the device
    Use "dynamic-list" to query the device via the 'list' command; "static-list" to check the pcmk_host_list attribute; "status" to query the device via the 'status' command; or "none" to assume every device can fence every node. The default value is "static-list" if pcmk_host_map or pcmk_host_list is set; otherwise "dynamic-list" if the device supports the list operation; otherwise "status" if the device supports the status operation; otherwise "none"  Allowed values: dynamic-list, static-list, status, none
    Allowed values: dynamic-list, static-list, status, none

pcmk_delay_max (time, [0s]): Enable a delay of no more than the time specified before executing fencing actions.
    Enable a delay of no more than the time specified before executing fencing actions. Pacemaker derives the overall delay by taking the value of pcmk_delay_base and adding a random delay value such that the sum is kept below this maximum.

pcmk_delay_base (string, [0s]): Enable a base delay for fencing actions and specify base delay value.
    This enables a static delay for fencing actions, which can help avoid "death matches" where two nodes try to fence each other at the same time. If pcmk_delay_max is also used, a random delay will be added such that the total delay is kept below that value. This can be set to a single time value to apply to any node targeted by this device (useful if a separate device is configured for each target), or to a node map (for example, "node1:1s;node2:5") to set a different value for each target.

pcmk_action_limit (integer, [1]): The maximum number of actions can be performed in parallel on this device
    Cluster property concurrent-fencing="true" needs to be configured first. Then use this to specify the maximum number of actions can be performed in parallel on this device. A value of -1 means an unlimited number of actions can be performed in parallel.

pcmk_reboot_action (string, [reboot]): *** Advanced Use Only *** An alternate command to run instead of 'reboot'
    Some devices do not support the standard commands or may provide additional ones. Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, command that implements the 'reboot' action.

pcmk_reboot_timeout (time, [60s]): *** Advanced Use Only *** Specify an alternate timeout to use for 'reboot' actions instead of stonith-timeout
    Some devices need much more/less time to complete than normal.Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, timeout for 'reboot' actions.

pcmk_reboot_retries (integer, [2]): *** Advanced Use Only *** The maximum number of times to try the 'reboot' command within the timeout period
    Some devices do not support multiple connections. Operations may "fail" if the device is busy with another task. In that case, Pacemaker will automatically retry the operation if there is time remaining. Use this option to alter the number of times Pacemaker tries a 'reboot' action before giving up.

pcmk_off_action (string, [off]): *** Advanced Use Only *** An alternate command to run instead of 'off'
    Some devices do not support the standard commands or may provide additional ones.Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, command that implements the 'off' action.
