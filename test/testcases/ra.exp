Example stateless resource agent (ocf:pacemaker:Dummy)

This is a Dummy Resource Agent. It does absolutely nothing except 
keep track of whether its running or not.
Its purpose in life is for testing and to serve as a template for RA writers.

NB: Please pay attention to the timeouts specified in the actions
section below. They should be meaningful for the kind of resource
the agent manages. They should be the minimum advised timeouts,
but they shouldn't/cannot cover _all_ possible resource
instances. So, try to be neither overly generous nor too stingy,
but moderate. The minimum timeouts should never be below 10 seconds.

Parameters (*: required, []: default):

state (string, [state-file]): State file
    Location to store the resource state in.

passwd (string): Password
    Fake password field

fake (string, [dummy]): 
    Fake attribute that can be changed to cause a reload

op_sleep (string, [0]): Operation sleep duration in seconds.
    Number of seconds to sleep during operations.  This can be used to test how
    the cluster reacts to operation timeouts.

fail_start_on (string): Report bogus start failure on specified host
    Start actions will return failure if running on the host specified here, but
    the resource will start successfully anyway (future monitor calls will find it
    running). This can be used to test on-fail=ignore.

envfile (string): Environment dump file
    If this is set, the environment will be dumped to this file for every call.

Operations' defaults (advisory minimum):

    start         timeout=20
    stop          timeout=20
    monitor       timeout=20 interval=10
    reload        timeout=20
    migrate_to    timeout=20
    migrate_from  timeout=20

.EXT crm_resource --show-metadata stonith:external/ssh
.EXT stonithd metadata
ssh STONITH device (stonith:external/ssh)

ssh-based host reset
Fine for testing, but not suitable for production!
Only reboot action supported, no poweroff, and, surprisingly enough, no poweron.

Parameters (*: required, []: default):

hostlist* (string): Hostlist
    The list of hosts that the STONITH device controls

livedangerously (enum): Live Dangerously!!
    Set to "yes" if you want to risk your system's integrity.
    Of course, since this plugin isn't for production, using it
    in production at all is a bad idea.  On the other hand,
    setting this parameter to yes makes it an even worse idea.
    Viva la Vida Loca!

priority (integer, [0]): The priority of the stonith resource. Devices are tried in order of highest priority to lowest.
pcmk_host_argument (string, [port]): Advanced use only: An alternate parameter to supply instead of 'port'
    Some devices do not support the standard 'port' parameter or may provide additional ones.
    Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, parameter that should indicate the machine to be fenced.
    A value of 'none' can be used to tell the cluster not to supply any additional parameters.

pcmk_host_map (string): A mapping of host names to ports numbers for devices that do not support host names.
    Eg. node1:1;node2:2,3 would tell the cluster to use port 1 for node1 and ports 2 and 3 for node2

pcmk_host_list (string): A list of machines controlled by this device (Optional unless pcmk_host_check=static-list).
pcmk_host_check (string, [dynamic-list]): How to determine which machines are controlled by the device.
    Allowed values: dynamic-list (query the device), static-list (check the pcmk_host_list attribute), none (assume every device can fence every machine)

pcmk_delay_max (time, [0s]): Enable a random delay for stonith actions and specify the maximum of random delay.
    This prevents double fencing when using slow devices such as sbd.
    Use this to enable a random delay for stonith actions.
    The overall delay is derived from this random delay value adding a static delay so that the sum is kept below the maximum delay.

pcmk_delay_base (time, [0s]): Enable a base delay for stonith actions and specify base delay value.
    This prevents double fencing when different delays are configured on the nodes.
    Use this to enable a static delay for stonith actions.
    The overall delay is derived from a random delay value adding this static delay so that the sum is kept below the maximum delay.

pcmk_action_limit (integer, [1]): The maximum number of actions can be performed in parallel on this device
    Pengine property concurrent-fencing=true needs to be configured first.
    Then use this to specify the maximum number of actions can be performed in parallel on this device. -1 is unlimited.

pcmk_reboot_action (string, [reboot]): Advanced use only: An alternate command to run instead of 'reboot'
    Some devices do not support the standard commands or may provide additional ones.
    Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, command that implements the 'reboot' action.

pcmk_reboot_timeout (time, [60s]): Advanced use only: Specify an alternate timeout to use for reboot actions instead of stonith-timeout
    Some devices need much more/less time to complete than normal.
    Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, timeout for 'reboot' actions.

pcmk_reboot_retries (integer, [2]): Advanced use only: The maximum number of times to retry the 'reboot' command within the timeout period
    Some devices do not support multiple connections. Operations may 'fail' if the device is busy with another task so Pacemaker will automatically retry the operation, if there is time remaining. Use this option to alter the number of times Pacemaker retries 'reboot' actions before giving up.

pcmk_off_action (string, [off]): Advanced use only: An alternate command to run instead of 'off'
    Some devices do not support the standard commands or may provide additional ones.
    Use this to specify an alternate, device-specific, command that implements the 'off' action.
