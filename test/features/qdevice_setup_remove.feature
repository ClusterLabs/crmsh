Feature: corosync qdevice/qnetd setup/remove process

  Test corosync qdevice/qnetd setup/remove process
  Tag @clean means need to stop cluster service if the service is available
  Need nodes: hanode1 hanode2 hanode3 hanode4 qnetd-node

  Background: Cluster and qdevice service are stopped
    Given   Cluster service is "stopped" on "hanode1"
    And     Cluster service is "stopped" on "hanode2"
