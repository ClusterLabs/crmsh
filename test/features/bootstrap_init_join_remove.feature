Feature: crmsh bootstrap process - init, join and remove

  Test crmsh bootstrap init/join/remove process
  Need nodes: hanode1 hanode2 hanode3

  Background: Setup a two nodes cluster
    Given   Nodes ["hanode1", "hanode2", "hanode3"] are cleaned up
    And     Cluster service is "stopped" on "hanode1"
    And     Cluster service is "stopped" on "hanode2"
    When    Run "crm cluster init -y" on "hanode1"
    Then    Cluster service is "started" on "hanode1"
    And     Show cluster status on "hanode1"
    When    Run "crm cluster join -c hanode1 -y" on "hanode2"
    Then    Cluster service is "started" on "hanode2"
    And     Online nodes are "hanode1 hanode2"
    And     two_node in corosync.conf is "1"
    And     Show cluster status on "hanode1"
    And     Cluster is using "knet" transport mode

  Scenario: Init cluster service on node "hanode1", and join on node "hanode2"

  Scenario: Support --all or specific node to manage cluster and nodes
