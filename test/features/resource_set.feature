@resource
Feature: Use "crm configure set" to update attributes and operations

  Tag @clean means need to stop cluster service if the service is available
  Need nodes: hanode1 hanode2

  Background: Setup cluster and configure some resources
    Given     Cluster service is "stopped" on "hanode1"
    When      Run "crm cluster init -y" on "hanode1"
    Then      Cluster service is "started" on "hanode1"
    When      Run "crm cluster join -c hanode1 -y" on "hanode2"
    Then      Cluster service is "started" on "hanode2"
    When      Run "crm configure primitive d Dummy op monitor interval=3s" on "hanode1"
    Then      Resource "d" type "Dummy" is "Started"
    When      Run "crm configure primitive vip IPaddr2 params ip=@vip.0 op monitor interval=3s" on "hanode1"
    Then      Resource "vip" type "IPaddr2" is "Started"
    And       Cluster virtual IP is "@vip.0"
    When      Run "crm configure primitive s ocf:pacemaker:Stateful op monitor role=Promoted interval=3s op monitor role=Unpromoted interval=5s" on "hanode1"
    Then      Resource "s" type "Stateful" is "Started"
