or crm help SUBCOMMAND

For a list of available subcommands, use crm help.

Use crm without arguments for an interactive session.
Call a subcommand directly for a "single-shot" use.
Call crm with a level name as argument to start an interactive
session from that level.

See the crm(8) man page or call crm help for more details.

positional arguments:
  SUBCOMMAND

  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Load commands from the given file. If a dash (-) is
                        used in place of a file name, crm will read commands
                        from the shell standard input (stdin).
  -c CIB, --cib CIB     Start the session using the given shadow CIB file.
                        Equivalent to `cib use <CIB>`.
  -D OUTPUT_TYPE, --display OUTPUT_TYPE
                        Choose one of the output options: plain, color-always,
                        color, or uppercase. The default is color if the
                        terminal emulation supports colors, else plain.
  -F, --force           Make crm proceed with applying changes where it would
                        normally ask the user to confirm before proceeding.
                        This option is mainly useful in scripts, and should be
                        used with care.
  -n, --no              Automatically answer no when prompted
  -w, --wait            Make crm wait for the cluster transition to finish
                        (for the changes to take effect) after each processed
                        line.
  -H DIR|FILE|SESSION, --history DIR|FILE|SESSION
                        A directory or file containing a cluster report to
                        load into history, or the name of a previously saved
                        history session.
  -d, --debug           Print verbose debugging information.
  -R, --regression-tests
                        Enables extra verbose trace logging used by the
                        regression tests. Logs all external calls made by
                        crmsh.
  --scriptdir DIR       Extra directory where crm looks for cluster scripts,
                        or a list of directories separated by semi-colons
                        (e.g. /dir1;/dir2;etc.).
  -X PROFILE            Collect profiling data and save in PROFILE.
  -o OPTION=VALUE, --opt OPTION=VALUE
                        Set crmsh option temporarily. If the options are saved
                        using+options save+ then the value passed here will
                        also be saved.Multiple options can be set by using
