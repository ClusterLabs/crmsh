shortdesc:  A utility for setting up LUKS-based disk encryption
longdesc: |
  Configure a resource group containing a virtual IP address,
  a filesystem resource containing the disk encryption keys and records,
  and a systemd instance of the cryptctl server.

  Furthermore a resource group will be created to bind all resources on the same node.
parameters:
  - name: id

    value: cryptctl
  - name: cert-path

    required: true
  - name: cert-key-path

    required: true

include:
  - script: virtual-ip
    shortdesc: The IP address configured here will start before the cryptctl instance.
