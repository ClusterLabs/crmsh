shortdesc: FENCING for libvirt (kvm / Xen)
longdesc: >
  Uses libvirt as a FENCING device to fence a guest node.
  Create a separate resource for each guest node in the cluster.

  Note that the recommended fencing mechanism is SBD whenever
  a shared storage device (like a SAN) is available.
category: Fencing
parameters:
  - name: id
    shortdesc: Resource ID (Name)
    example: stonith-libvirt
    required: true
    type: resource
  - name: target
    shortdesc: Node to Manage With STONITH Device
    type: resource
    required: true
  - name: hostlist
    shortdesc: "List of controlled hosts: hostname[:domain_id].."
    longdesc: >
      The optional domain_id defaults to the hostname.
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: hypervisor_uri
    longdesc: >
      URI for connection to the hypervisor.
      driver[+transport]://[username@][hostlist][:port]/[path][?extraparameters]
      e.g.
      qemu+ssh://my_kvm_server.mydomain.my/system   (uses ssh for root)
      xen://my_kvm_server.mydomain.my/              (uses TLS for client)

      virsh must be installed (e.g. libvirt-client package) and access control must
      be configured for your selected URI.
    example: qemu+ssh://my_kvm_server.example.com/system
    required: true
  - name: reset_method
    required: false
    example: power_cycle
    type: string
    shortdesc: Guest Reset Method
    longdesc: >
      A guest reset may be done by a sequence of off and on commands
      (power_cycle) or by the reboot command. Which method works
      depend on the hypervisor and guest configuration management.
