    shortdesc: Automatic Recover
    longdesc: >-
      The SAPInstance resource agent tries to recover a failed start
      attempt automaticaly one time. This is done by killing runing
      instance processes, removing the kill.sap file and executing
      cleanipc. Sometimes a crashed SAP instance leaves some
      processes and/or shared memory segments behind. Setting this
      option to true will try to remove those leftovers during a
      start operation. That is to reduce manual work for the
      administrator.
