# Revised UI structure for crmsh
#
# Goals:
#
# - Modularity
# - Reduced global state
# - Separate static hierarchy from current context
# - Fix completion
# - Implement bash completion
# - Retain all previous functionality
# - Have per-level pre-requirements:
#   def requires(self): <- raise error if prereqs are not met
#   This is so that crmsh can be installed with minimal prereqs,
#   and use cluster sublevel to install all requirements
