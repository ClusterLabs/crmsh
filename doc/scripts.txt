.Version information
NOTE: This section applies to the in-development `crmsh 2.0+` only.

== Introduction ==

A big part of the configuration and management of a cluster is
collecting information about all cluster nodes and deploying changes
to those nodes. Often, just performing the same procedure on all nodes
will encounter problems, due to subtle differences in the
configuration.

For example, when configuring a cluster for the first time, the
software needs to be installed and configured on all nodes before the
cluster software can be launched and configured using `crmsh`. This
process is cumbersome and error-prone, and the goal is for scripts to
make this process easier.

Another important function of scripts is collecting information and
reporting potential issues with the cluster. For example, software
versions may differ between nodes, causing byzantine errors or random
failure. `crmsh` comes packaged with a `health` script which will
detect and warn about many of these types of problems.

There are many tools for managing a collection of nodes, and scripts
are not intended to replace these tools. Rather, they provide an
integrated way to perform tasks across the cluster that would
otherwise be tedious, repetitive and error-prone. The scripts
functionality in the crm shell is mainly inspired by Ansible, a
light-weight and efficient configuration management tool.

Scripts are implemented using the `parallel-ssh` package which
provides a thin wrapper on top of SSH. This allows the scripts to
function through the usual SSH channels used for system maintenance,
requiring no additional software to be installed or maintained.

== Usage ==

Scripts are available through the `cluster` sub-level in the crm
shell. Some scripts have custom commands linked to them for
convenience, such as the `init`, `join` and `remove` commands for
creating new clusters, introducing new nodes into the cluster and for
removing nodes from a running cluster.

Other scripts can be accessed through the `script` sub-level inside
`cluster`.

=== List available scripts ===

To list the available scripts, use the following command:

.........
# crm script
list
.........

The available scripts are listed along with a short description.

=== Script description ===

To get more details about a script, run the `describe` command. For
example, to get more information about what the `health` script does
and what parameters it accepts, use the following command:

.........
# crm script
describe health
.........

`describe` will print a longer explanation for the script, along with
a list of parameters, each parameter having a description, a note
saying if it is an optional or required parameter, and if optional,
what the default value is.

=== Running a script ===

To run a script, all required parameters and any optional parameters
that should have values other than the default should be provided as
`key=value` pairs on the command line. The following example shows how 
to call the `health` script with verbose output enabled:

........
# crm script
run health verbose=true
........


== Creating a script ==

This section will describe how to create a new script, where to put
the script to allow `crmsh` to find it, and how to test that the
script works as intended.

=== How scripts work, in detail ===

When the script runs, the steps defined in `main.yml` as described
below are executed one at a time. Each step describes an action that
is applied to the cluster, either by calling out and running scripts
on each of the cluster nodes, or by running a script locally on the
node from which the command was executed.

=== Actions ===

Scripts perform actions that are classified into a few basic
types. Each action is performed by calling out to a shell script,
but the arguments and location of that script varies depending on the
type.

Here are the types of script actions that can be performed:

Collect::
  * Runs on all cluster nodes
  * Gathers information about the nodes, both general information and
    information specific to the script.

Validate::
  * Runs on the local node
  * Validate parameter values and node state based on collected
    information. Can modify default values and report issues that
    would prevent the script from applying successfully.

Apply::
  * Runs on all or any cluster nodes
  * Applies changes, returning information about the applied changes
    to the local node.

Apply-Local::
  * Runs on the local node
  * Applies changes to the cluster, where an action taken on a single
    node affect the entire cluster. This includes updating the CIB in
    Pacemaker, and also reloading the configuration for Corosync.

Report::
  * Runs on the local node
  * This is similar to the _Apply-Local_ action, with the difference
    that the output of a Report action is not interpreted as JSON data
    to be passed to the next action. Instead, the output is printed to
    the screen.


=== Basic structure ===

The crm shell looks for scripts in two primary locations: Included
scripts  are installed in the system-wide shared folder, usually
`/usr/share/crmsh/scripts/`. Local and custom scripts are loaded from
the user-local XDG_CONFIG folder, usually found at
`~/.local/crm/scripts/`. These locations may differ depending on how
the crm shell was installed and which system is used, but these are
the locations used on most distributions.

To create a new script, make a new folder in the user-local scripts
folder and give it a unique name. In this example, we will call our
new script `check-uptime`.

........
mkdir -p ~/.local/crm/scripts/check-uptime
........

In this directory, create a file called `main.yml`. This is a YAML
document which describes the script, which parameters it requires, and
what actions it will perform.

YAML is a human-readable markup language which is designed to be easy
to read and modify, while at the same time be compatible with JSON. To
learn more, see http:://yaml.org/[yaml.org].

Here is an example `main.yml` file, heavily commented to explain what
each section means.

[source,yaml]
----
---
# The triple-dash indicates that this is a yaml document.
# All yaml documents should begin with this line.
- name: Check uptime of nodes
  description: >
    This script will fetch the uptime of
    all nodes and report which node has been
    up the longest.
  parameters:
    # Parameters must have a name and description.
    # If a default value is provided, the parameter
    # is considered optional. Parameters without a
    # default value must be provided when running the
    # script.
    - name: show_all
      description: Show all uptimes
      default: false
  steps:
    # Steps consist of a descriptive name and an action which
    # calls a script to do its work. The script should be an
    # executable file located in the same folder as main.yml.
    #
    # Script files can be written in any language, as long as
    # the cluster nodes know how to execute them.
    #
    # These are the valid actions:
    # collect:
    #     Runs on all nodes. Should not perform changes, only
    #     gather and return information.
    # validate:
    #     Runs on the local node only. Should report problems
    #     that would prevent further progress. If validate returns
    #     a map of values, matching script parameters are updated
    #     to reflect those values.
    # apply:
    #     Runs on all nodes. Applies changes.
    #     If the dry_run flag is set, script execution stops
    #     before the first apply action.
    #
    # apply_local:
    #     Runs on the local node only. Otherwise same as apply.
    #
    # report:
    #     Runs on the local node only. Output from this step is
    #     printed, not saved as input to the following steps.
    #     This output does not have to be in JSON format.
    - name: Fetch uptime
      collect: fetch.py
    - name: Report uptime
      report: report.py
----

The actions must not be Python scripts. They can be plain bash scripts
or any other executable script as long as the nodes have the necessary
dependencies installed. However, see below why implementing scripts in
Python is easier.

Actions report their progress either by returning JSON on standard
output, or by returning a non-zero return value and printing an error
message to standard error.

Any JSON returned by an action will be available to the following
steps in the script. When the script executes, it does so in a
temporary folder created for that purpose. In that folder is a file
named `script.input`, containing a JSON array with the output produced
by previous steps.

The first element in the array (the zeroth element, to be precise) is
a dict containing the parameter values. 

The following elements are dicts with the hostname of each node as key
and the output of the action generated by that node as value.

In most cases, only local actions (`validate` and `apply_local`) will
use the information in previous steps, but scripts are not limited in
what they can do.

With this knowledge, we can implement `fetch.py` and `report.py`.

`fetch.py`:

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python
import crm_script
try:
    uptime = open('/proc/uptime').read().split()[0]
    crm_script.exit_ok(uptime)
except:
    crm_script.exit_fail("Couldn't open /proc/uptime")
----

`report.py`:

[source,python]
----
#!/usr/bin/env python
import crm_script
show_all = crm_script.is_true(crm_script.param('show_all'))
uptimes = crm_script.output(1).items()
max_uptime = '', 0
for host, uptime in uptimes:
    if uptime > max_uptime[1]:
        max_uptime = host, uptime
if show_all:
    print "Uptimes: %s" % (', '.join("%s: %s" % v for v in uptimes))
print "Longest uptime is %s seconds on host %s" % (max_uptime[1], max_uptime[0])
----

See below for more details on the helper library `crm_script`.

Save the scripts as executable files in the same directory as the
`main.yml` file.

Before running the script, it is possible to verify that the files are
in a valid format and in the right location. Run the following
command:

........
crm script verify check-uptime
........

If the verification is successful, try executing the script with the
following command:

........
crm script run check-uptime
........

Example output:

[source,bash]
----
# crm script run check-uptime
INFO: Check uptime of nodes
INFO: Nodes: ha-three, ha-one
OK: Fetch uptimes
OK: Report uptime
Longest uptime is 161054.04 seconds on host ha-one
----

To see if the `show_all` parameter works as intended, run the
following:

........
crm script run check-uptime show_all=yes
........

Example output:

[source,bash]
----
# crm script run check-uptime show_all=yes
INFO: Check uptime of nodes
INFO: Nodes: ha-three, ha-one
OK: Fetch uptimes
OK: Report uptime
Uptimes: ha-one: 161069.83, ha-three: 159950.38
Longest uptime is 161069.83 seconds on host ha-one
----

=== Remote permissions ===

Some scripts may require super-user access to remote or local
nodes. It is recommended that this is handled through SSH certificates
and agents, to facilitate password-less access to nodes.

=== Running scripts without a cluster ===

All cluster scripts can optionally take a `nodes` argument, which
determines the nodes that the script will run on. This node list is
not limited to nodes already in the cluster. It is even possible to
execute cluster scripts before a cluster is set up, such as the
`health` and `init` scripts used by the `cluster` sub-level.

........
crm script run health nodes=example1,example2
........

The list of nodes can be comma- or space-separated, but if the list
contains spaces, the whole argument will have to be quoted:

........
crm script run health nodes="example1 example2"
........

=== Running in validate mode ===

It may be desirable to do a dry-run of a script, to see if any
problems are present that would make the script fail before trying to
apply it. To do this, add the argument `dry_run=yes` to the invocation:

.........
crm script run health dry_run=yes
.........

The script execution will stop at the first `apply` action. Note that
non-modifying steps that happen after the first `apply` action will
not be performed in a dry run.

=== Helper library ===

When the script data is copied to each node, a small helper library is
also passed along with the script. This library can be found in
`utils/crm_script.py` in the source repository. This library helps
with producing output in the correct format, parsing the
`script.input` data provided to scripts, and more.
