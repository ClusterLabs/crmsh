NAME
----
crm - Pacemaker command line interface for configuration and management


SYNOPSIS
--------
*crm* [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND ARGS...]


[[topics_Description,Program description]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `crm` shell is a command-line based cluster configuration and
management tool. Its goal is to assist as much as possible with the
configuration and maintenance of Pacemaker-based High Availability
clusters.

For more information on Pacemaker itself, see http://clusterlabs.org/.

`crm` works both as a command-line tool to be called directly from the
system shell, and as an interactive shell with extensive tab
completion and help.

The primary focus of the `crm` shell is to provide a simplified and
consistent interface to Pacemaker, but it also provides tools for
managing the creation and configuration of High Availability clusters
from scratch. To learn more about this aspect of `crm`, see the
`cluster` section below.

The `crm` shell can be used to manage every aspect of configuring and
maintaining a cluster. It provides a simplified line-based syntax on
top of the XML configuration format used by Pacemaker, commands for
starting and stopping resources, tools for exploring the history of a
cluster including log scraping and a set of cluster scripts useful for
automating the setup and installation of services on the cluster
nodes.

The `crm` shell is line oriented: every command must start and finish
on the same line. It is possible to use a continuation character (+\+)
to write one command in two or more lines. The continuation character
is commonly used when displaying configurations.

[[topics_CommandLine,Command line options]]
OPTIONS
-------
*-f, --file*='FILE'::
    Load commands from the given file. If a dash +-+ is used in place
    of a file name, `crm` will read commands from the shell standard
    input (`stdin`).

*-c, --cib*='CIB'::
    Start the session using the given shadow CIB file.
    Equivalent to +cib use <CIB>+.

*-D, --display=*'OUTPUT_TYPE'::
    Choose one of the output options: +plain+, +color-always+, +color+,
    or +uppercase+. The default is +color+ if the terminal emulation
    supports colors. Otherwise, +plain+ is used.

*-F, --force*::
    Make `crm` proceed with applying changes where it would normally
    ask the user to confirm before proceeding. This option is mainly
    useful in scripts, and should be used with care.

*-w, --wait*::
    Make `crm` wait for the cluster transition to finish (for the
    changes to take effect) after each processed line.

*-H, --history*='DIR|FILE|SESSION'::
    A directory or file containing a cluster report to load
    into the `history` commands, or the name of a previously
    saved history session.

*-h, --help*::
    Print help page.

*--version*::
    Print crmsh version and build information (Mercurial Hg changeset
    hash).

*-d, --debug*::
    Print verbose debugging information.

*-R, --regression-tests*::
    Enables extra verbose trace logging used by the regression
    tests. Logs all external calls made by crmsh.

*--scriptdir*='DIR'::
    Extra directory where crm looks for cluster scripts, or a list of
    directories separated by semi-colons (e.g. +/dir1;/dir2;etc.+).

*-o, --opt*='OPTION=VALUE'::
     Set crmsh option temporarily. If the options are saved using
     +options save+ then the value passed here will also be saved.
     Multiple options can be set by using +-o+ multiple times.

[[topics_Introduction,Introduction]]
== Introduction

This section of the user guide covers general topics about the user
interface and describes some of the features of `crmsh` in detail.

[[topics_Introduction_Interface,User interface]]
=== User interface

The main purpose of `crmsh` is to provide a simple yet powerful
interface to the cluster stack. There are two main modes of operation
with the user interface of `crmsh`:

* Command line (single-shot) use - Use `crm` as a regular UNIX command
  from your usual shell. `crm` has full bash completion built in, so
  using it in this manner should be as comfortable and familiar as
  using any other command-line tool.

* Interactive mode - By calling `crm` without arguments, or by calling
  it with only a sublevel as argument, `crm` enters the interactive
  mode. In this mode, it acts as its own command shell, which
  remembers which sublevel you are currently in and allows for rapid
  and convenient execution of multiple commands within the same
  sublevel. This mode also has full tab completion, as well as
  built-in interactive help and syntax highlighting.

Here are a few examples of using `crm` both as a command-line tool and
as an interactive shell:

.Command line (one-shot) use:
........
# crm resource stop www_app
........

.Interactive use:
........
# crm
crm(live)# resource
crm(live)resource# unmanage tetris_1
crm(live)resource# up
crm(live)# node standby node4
........

.Cluster configuration:
........
# crm configure<<EOF
  #
  # resources
  #
  primitive disk0 iscsi \
    params portal=192.168.2.108:3260 target=iqn.2008-07.com.suse:disk0

    params device=/dev/disk/by-label/disk0 directory=/disk0 fstype=ext3

    params configfile=/disk0/etc/apache2/site0.conf

    params ttydev=/dev/ttyS0 hostlist="node1 node2" \

    rule 50: #uname eq node1 \
    rule pingd: defined pingd
  #
  # cluster properties
  #
  property stonith-enabled=true
  commit
EOF
........

The `crm` interface is hierarchical, with commands organized into
separate levels by functionality. To list the available levels and
commands, either execute +help <level>+, or, if at the top level of
the shell, simply typing `help` will provide an overview of all
available levels and commands.

The +(live)+ string in the `crm` prompt signifies that the current CIB
in use is the cluster live configuration. It is also possible to
work with so-called <<topics_Features_Shadows,shadow CIBs>>. These are separate, inactive
configurations stored in files, that can be applied and thereby
replace the live configuration at any time.

[[topics_Introduction_Completion,Tab completion]]
=== Tab completion

The `crm` makes extensive use of tab completion. The completion
is both static (i.e. for `crm` commands) and dynamic. The latter
takes into account the current status of the cluster or
information from installed resource agents. Sometimes, completion
may also be used to get short help on resource parameters. Here
are a few examples:

...............
crm(live)resource# <TAB><TAB>
bye           failcount     move          restart       unmigrate
cd            help          param         show          unmove
cleanup       list          promote       start         up
demote        manage        quit          status        utilization
end           meta          refresh       stop
exit          migrate       reprobe       unmanage

crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 <TAB><TAB>
heartbeat:  lsb:    ocf:    stonith:

crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:<TAB><TAB>
apcmaster                external/ippower9258     fence_legacy
apcmastersnmp            external/kdumpcheck      ibmhmc
apcsmart                 external/libvirt         ipmilan

crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:ipmilan params <TAB><TAB>
auth=      hostname=  ipaddr=    login=     password=  port=      priv=

crm(live)configure# primitive fence-1 stonith:ipmilan params auth=<TAB><TAB>
auth* (string)
    The authorization type of the IPMI session ("none", "straight", "md2", or "md5")
...............

`crmsh` also comes with bash completion usable directly from the
system shell. This should be installed automatically with the command
itself.

[[topics_Introduction_Shorthand,Shorthand syntax]]
=== Shorthand syntax

When using the `crm` shell to manage clusters, you will end up typing
a lot of commands many times over. Clear command names like
+configure+ help in understanding and learning to use the cluster
shell, but is easy to misspell and is tedious to type repeatedly. The
interactive mode and tab completion both help with this, but the `crm`
shell also has the ability to understand a variety of shorthand
aliases for all of the commands.

For example, instead of typing `crm status`, you can type `crm st` or
`crm stat`. Instead of `crm configure` you can type `crm cfg` or even
`crm cf`. `crm resource` can be shorted as `crm rsc`, and so on.

The exact list of accepted aliases is too long to print in full, but
experimentation and typoes should help in discovering more of them.

[[topics_Features,Features]]
== Features

The feature set of crmsh covers a wide range of functionality, and
understanding how and when to use the various features of the shell
can be difficult. This section of the guide describes some of the
features and use cases of `crmsh` in more depth. The intention is to
provide a deeper understanding of these features, but also to serve as
a guide to using them.

[[topics_Features_Shadows,Shadow CIB usage]]
=== Shadow CIB usage

A Shadow CIB is a normal cluster configuration stored in a file.
They may be manipulated in much the same way as the _live_ CIB, with
the key difference that changes to a shadow CIB have no effect on the
actual cluster resources. An administrator may choose to apply any of
them to the cluster, thus replacing the running configuration with the
one found in the shadow CIB.

The `crm` prompt always contains the name of the configuration which
is currently in use, or the string _live_ if using the live cluster
configuration.

When editing the configuration in the `configure` level, no changes
are actually applied until the `commit` command is executed. It is
possible to start editing a configuration as usual, but instead of
committing the changes to the active CIB, save them to a shadow CIB.

The following example `configure` session demonstrates how this can be
done:
...............
crm(live)configure# cib new test-2
INFO: test-2 shadow CIB created
crm(test-2)configure# commit
...............

[[topics_Features_Checks,Configuration semantic checks]]
=== Configuration semantic checks

Resource definitions may be checked against the meta-data
provided with the resource agents. These checks are currently
carried out:

- are required parameters set
- existence of defined parameters
- timeout values for operations

The parameter checks are obvious and need no further explanation.
Failures in these checks are treated as configuration errors.

The timeouts for operations should be at least as long as those
recommended in the meta-data. Too short timeout values are a
common mistake in cluster configurations and, even worse, they
often slip through if cluster testing was not thorough. Though
operation timeouts issues are treated as warnings, make sure that
the timeouts are usable in your environment. Note also that the
values given are just _advisory minimum_---your resources may
require longer timeouts.

User may tune the frequency of checks and the treatment of errors
by the <<cmdhelp_options_check-frequency,`check-frequency`>> and
<<cmdhelp_options_check-mode,`check-mode`>> preferences.

Note that if the +check-frequency+ is set to +always+ and the
+check-mode+ to +strict+, errors are not tolerated and such
configuration cannot be saved.

[[topics_Features_Templates,Configuration templates]]
=== Configuration templates

.Deprecation note
****************************
Configuration templates have been deprecated in favor of the more
capable `cluster scripts`. To learn how to use cluster scripts, see
the dedicated documentation on the `crmsh` website at
http://crmsh.github.io/, or in the <<cmdhelp_script,Script section>>.
****************************

Configuration templates are ready made configurations created by
cluster experts. They are designed in such a way so that users
may generate valid cluster configurations with minimum effort.
If you are new to Pacemaker, templates may be the best way to
start.

We will show here how to create a simple yet functional Apache
configuration:
...............
# crm configure
crm(live)configure# template
crm(live)configure template# list templates
apache       filesystem   virtual-ip
crm(live)configure template# new web <TAB><TAB>
apache       filesystem   virtual-ip
crm(live)configure template# new web apache
INFO: pulling in template apache
INFO: pulling in template virtual-ip
crm(live)configure template# list
web2-d       web2     vip2     web3     vip      web
...............

We enter the `template` level from `configure`. Use the `list`
command to show templates available on the system. The `new`
command creates a configuration from the +apache+ template. You
can use tab completion to pick templates. Note that the apache
template depends on a virtual IP address which is automatically
pulled along. The `list` command shows the just created +web+
configuration, among other configurations (I hope that you,
unlike me, will use more sensible and descriptive names).

The `show` command, which displays the resulting configuration,
may be used to get an idea about the minimum required changes
which have to be done. All +ERROR+ messages show the line numbers
in which the respective parameters are to be defined:
...............
crm(live)configure template# show
ERROR: 23: required parameter ip not set
ERROR: 61: required parameter id not set
ERROR: 65: required parameter configfile not set
crm(live)configure template# edit
...............

The `edit` command invokes the preferred text editor with the
+web+ configuration. At the top of the file, the user is advised
how to make changes. A good template should require from the user
to specify only parameters. For example, the +web+ configuration
we created above has the following required and optional
parameters (all parameter lines start with +%%+):
...............
$ grep -n ^%% ~/.crmconf/web
23:%% ip
31:%% netmask
35:%% lvs_support
61:%% id
65:%% configfile
71:%% options
76:%% envfiles
...............

These lines are the only ones that should be modified. Simply
append the parameter value at the end of the line. For instance,
after editing this template, the result could look like this (we
used tabs instead of spaces to make the values stand out):
...............
$ grep -n ^%% ~/.crmconf/web
23:%% ip        192.168.1.101
31:%% netmask
35:%% lvs_support
61:%% id        websvc
65:%% configfile    /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
71:%% options
76:%% envfiles
...............

As you can see, the parameter line format is very simple:
...............
%% <name> <value>
...............

After editing the file, use `show` again to display the
configuration:
...............
crm(live)configure template# show
primitive virtual-ip IPaddr \
    params ip=192.168.1.101
primitive apache apache \
    params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf"
monitor apache 120s:60s
group websvc \
    apache virtual-ip
...............

The target resource of the apache template is a group which we
named +websvc+ in this sample session.

This configuration looks exactly as you could type it at the
`configure` level. The point of templates is to save you some
typing. It is important, however, to understand the configuration
produced.

Finally, the configuration may be applied to the current
crm configuration (note how the configuration changed slightly,
though it is still equivalent, after being digested at the
`configure` level):
...............
crm(live)configure template# apply
crm(live)configure template# cd ..
crm(live)configure# show
node xen-b
node xen-c
primitive apache apache \
    params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" \
    op monitor interval=120s timeout=60s
primitive virtual-ip IPaddr \
    params ip=192.168.1.101
group websvc apache virtual-ip
...............

Note that this still does not commit the configuration to the CIB
which is used in the shell, either the running one (+live+) or
some shadow CIB. For that you still need to execute the `commit`
command.

To complete our example, we should also define the preferred node
to run the service:

...............
crm(live)configure# location websvc-pref websvc 100: xen-b
...............

If you are not happy with some resource names which are provided
by default, you can rename them now:

...............
crm(live)configure# rename virtual-ip intranet-ip
crm(live)configure# show
node xen-b
node xen-c
primitive apache apache \
    params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" \
    op monitor interval=120s timeout=60s
primitive intranet-ip IPaddr \
    params ip=192.168.1.101
group websvc apache intranet-ip
location websvc-pref websvc 100: xen-b
...............

To summarize, working with templates typically consists of the
following steps:

- `new`: create a new configuration from templates
- `edit`: define parameters, at least the required ones
- `show`: see if the configuration is valid
- `apply`: apply the configuration to the `configure` level

[[topics_Features_Testing,Resource testing]]
=== Resource testing

The amount of detail in a cluster makes all configurations prone
to errors. By far the largest number of issues in a cluster is
due to bad resource configuration. The shell can help quickly
diagnose such problems. And considerably reduce your keyboard
wear.

Let's say that we entered the following configuration:
...............
node xen-b
node xen-c
node xen-d
primitive fencer stonith:external/libvirt \
    params hypervisor_uri="qemu+tcp://10.2.13.1/system" \
        hostlist="xen-b xen-c xen-d" \
    op monitor interval=2h
primitive svc Xinetd \
    params service=systat \
    op monitor interval=30s
primitive intranet-ip IPaddr2 \
    params ip=10.2.13.100 \
    op monitor interval=30s
primitive apache apache \
    params configfile="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" \
    op monitor interval=120s timeout=60s
group websvc apache intranet-ip
location websvc-pref websvc 100: xen-b
...............

Before typing `commit` to submit the configuration to the cib we
can make sure that all resources are usable on all nodes:
...............
crm(live)configure# rsctest websvc svc fencer
...............

It is important that resources being tested are not running on
any nodes. Otherwise, the `rsctest` command will refuse to do
anything. Of course, if the current configuration resides in a
CIB shadow, then a `commit` is irrelevant. The point being that
resources are not running on any node.

.Note on stopping all resources
****************************
Alternatively to not committing a configuration, it is also
possible to tell Pacemaker not to start any resources:

...............
crm(live)configure# property stop-all-resources=yes
...............
Almost none---resources of class stonith are still started. But
shell is not as strict when it comes to stonith resources.
****************************

Order of resources is significant insofar that a resource depends
on all resources to its left. In most configurations, it's
probably practical to test resources in several runs, based on
their dependencies.

Apart from groups, `crm` does not interpret constraints and
therefore knows nothing about resource dependencies. It also
doesn't know if a resource can run on a node at all in case of an
asymmetric cluster. It is up to the user to specify a list of
eligible nodes if a resource is not meant to run on every node.

[[topics_Features_Security,Access Control Lists (ACL)]]
=== Access Control Lists (ACL)

.Note on ACLs in Pacemaker 1.1.12
****************************
The support for ACLs has been revised in Pacemaker version 1.1.12 and
up. Depending on which version you are using, the information in this
section may no longer be accurate. Look for the `acl_target`
configuration element for more details on the new syntax.
****************************

By default, the users from the +haclient+ group have full access
to the cluster (or, more precisely, to the CIB). Access control
lists allow for finer access control to the cluster.

Access control lists consist of an ordered set of access rules.
Each rule allows read or write access or denies access
completely. Rules are typically combined to produce a specific
role. Then, users may be assigned a role.

For instance, this is a role which defines a set of rules
allowing management of a single resource:

...............
role bigdb_admin \
    write meta:bigdb:target-role \
    write meta:bigdb:is-managed \
    write location:bigdb \
    read ref:bigdb
...............

The first two rules allow modifying the +target-role+ and
+is-managed+ meta attributes which effectively enables users in
this role to stop/start and manage/unmanage the resource. The
constraints write access rule allows moving the resource around.
Finally, the user is granted read access to the resource
definition.

For proper operation of all Pacemaker programs, it is advisable
to add the following role to all users:

...............
role read_all \
    read cib
...............

For finer grained read access try with the rules listed in the
following role:

...............
role basic_read \
    read node attribute:uname \
    read node attribute:type \
    read property \
    read status
...............

It is however possible that some Pacemaker programs (e.g.
`ptest`) may not function correctly if the whole CIB is not
readable.

Some of the ACL rules in the examples above are expanded by the
shell to XPath specifications. For instance, 
+meta:bigdb:target-role+ expands to:

........
//primitive[@id='bigdb']/meta_attributes/nvpair[@name='target-role']
........

You can see the expansion by showing XML:

...............
crm(live) configure# show xml bigdb_admin
...
<acls>
  <acl_role id="bigdb_admin">
      <write id="bigdb_admin-write"
      xpath="//primitive[@id='bigdb']/meta_attributes/nvpair[@name='target-role']"/>
...............

Many different XPath expressions can have equal meaning. For
instance, the following two are equal, but only the first one is
going to be recognized as shortcut:

...............
//primitive[@id='bigdb']/meta_attributes/nvpair[@name='target-role']
//resources/primitive[@id='bigdb']/meta_attributes/nvpair[@name='target-role']
...............

XPath is a powerful language, but you should try to keep your ACL
xpaths simple and the builtin shortcuts should be used whenever
possible.

[[topics_Features_Resourcesets,Syntax: Resource sets]]
=== Syntax: Resource sets

Using resource sets can be a bit confusing unless one knows the
details of the implementation in Pacemaker as well as how to interpret
the syntax provided by `crmsh`.

Three different types of resource sets are provided by `crmsh`, and
each one implies different values for the two resource set attributes,
+sequential+ and +require-all+.

+sequential+::
  If true, the resources in the set do not depend on each other
  internally. Setting +sequential+ to +true+ implies a strict order of
  dependency within the set.

+require-all+::
  If false, only one resource in the set is required to fulfil the
  requirements of the set. The set of A, B and C with +require-all+
  set to +false+ is be read as "A OR B OR C" when its dependencies
  are resolved.

The three types of resource sets modify the attributes in the
following way:

1. Implicit sets (no brackets). +sequential=true+, +require-all=true+
2. Parenthesis set (+(+ ... +)+). +sequential=false+, +require-all=true+
3. Bracket set (+[+ ... +]+). +sequential=false+, +require-all=false+

To create a set with the properties +sequential=true+ and
+require-all=false+, explicitly set +sequential+ in a bracketed set,
+[ A B C sequential=true ]+.

To create multiple sets with both +sequential+ and +require-all+ set to
true, explicitly set +sequential+ in a parenthesis set:
+A B ( C D sequential=true )+.

[[topics_Features_AttributeListReferences,Syntax: Attribute list references]]
=== Syntax: Attribute list references

Attribute lists are used to set attributes and parameters for
resources, constraints and property definitions. For example, to set
the virtual IP used by an +IPAddr2+ resource the attribute +ip+ can be
set in an attribute list for that resource.

Attribute lists can have identifiers that name them, and other
resources can reuse the same attribute list by referring to that name
using an +$id-ref+. For example, the following statement defines a
simple dummy resource with an attribute list which sets the parameter
+state+ to the value 1 and sets the identifier for the attribute list
to +on-state+:

..............
primitive dummy-1 Dummy params $id=on-state state=1
..............

To refer to this attribute list from a different resource, refer to
the +on-state+ name using an id-ref:

..............
primitive dummy-2 Dummy params $id-ref=on-state
..............

The resource +dummy-2+ will now also have the parameter +state+ set to the value 1.

[[topics_Features_AttributeReferences,Syntax: Attribute references]]
=== Syntax: Attribute references

In some cases, referencing complete attribute lists is too
coarse-grained, for example if two different parameters with different
names should have the same value set. Instead of having to copy the
value in multiple places, it is possible to create references to
individual attributes in attribute lists.

To name an attribute in order to be able to refer to it later, prefix
the attribute name with a +$+ character (as seen above with the
special names +$id+ and +$id-ref+:

............
primitive dummy-1 Dummy params $state=1
............

The identifier +state+ can now be used to refer to this attribute from other
primitives, using the +@<id>+ syntax:

............
primitive dummy-2 Dummy params @state
............

In some cases, using the attribute name as the identifier doesn't work
due to name clashes. In this case, the syntax +$<id>:<name>=<value>+
can be used to give the attribute a different identifier:

............
primitive dummy-1 params $dummy-state-on:state=1
primitive dummy-2 params @dummy-state-on
............

There is also the possibility that two resources both use the same
attribute value but with different names. For example, a web server
may have a parameter +server_ip+ for setting the IP address where it
listens for incoming requests, and a virtual IP resource may have a
parameter called +ip+ which sets the IP address it creates. To
configure these two resources with an IP without repeating the value,
the reference can be given a name using the syntax +@<id>:<name>+.

Example:
............
primitive virtual-ip IPaddr2 params $vip:ip=192.168.1.100
primitive webserver apache params @vip:server_ip
............

[[topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions]]
=== Syntax: Rule expressions

Many of the configuration commands in `crmsh` now support the use of
_rule expressions_, which can influence what attributes apply to a
resource or under which conditions a constraint is applied, depending
on changing conditions like date, time, the value of attributes and
more.

Here is an example of a simple rule expression used to apply a
a different resource parameter on the node named `node1`:

..............
primitive my_resource Special \
  params 2: rule #uname eq node1 interface=eth1 \
  params 1: interface=eth0
..............

This primitive resource has two lists of parameters with descending
priority. The parameter list with the highest priority is applied
first, but only if the rule expressions for that parameter list all
apply. In this case, the rule `#uname eq node1` limits the parameter
list so that it is only applied on `node1.

Note that rule expressions are not terminated and are immediately
followed by the data to which the rule is applied. In this case, the
name-value pair `interface=eth1`.

Rule expressions can contain multiple expressions connected using the
boolean operator `or` and `and`. The full syntax for rule expressions
is listed below.

..............

[[topics_Reference,Command reference]]
== Command reference

The commands are structured to be compatible with the shell command
line. Sometimes, the underlying Pacemaker grammar uses characters that
have special meaning in bash, that will need to be quoted. This
includes the hash or pound sign (`#`), single and double quotes, and
any significant whitespace.

Whitespace is also significant when assigning values, meaning that
+key=value+ is different from +key = value+.

Commands can be referenced using short-hand as long as the short-hand
is unique. This can be either a prefix of the command name or a prefix
string of characters found in the name.

For example, +status+ can be abbreviated as +st+ or +su+, and
+configure+ as +conf+ or +cfg+.

The syntax for the commands is given below in an informal, BNF-like
grammar.

* `<value>` denotes a string.
* `[value]` means that the construct is optional.
* The ellipsis (`...`) signifies that the previous construct may be
  repeated.
* `first|second` means either first or second.
* The rest are literals (strings, `:`, `=`).

[[cmdhelp_root_status,Cluster status]]
=== `status`

Show cluster status. The status is displayed by `crm_mon`. Supply
additional arguments for more information or different format.
See `crm_mon(8)` for more details.

verify [scores]
...............


[[cmdhelp_cluster,Cluster setup and management]]
=== `cluster` - Cluster setup and management

Whole-cluster configuration management with High Availability
awareness.

The commands on the cluster level allows configuration and
modification of the underlying cluster infrastructure, and also
supplies tools to do whole-cluster systems management.

These commands enable easy installation and maintenance of a HA
cluster, by providing support for package installation, configuration
of the cluster messaging layer, file system setup and more.

[[cmdhelp_cluster_add,Add a new node to the cluster]]
==== `add`

This command simplifies the process of adding a new node to a running
cluster. The new node will be installed and configured with the
packages and configuration files needed to run the cluster
resources. If a cluster file system is used, the new node will be set
up to host the file system.

This command should be executed from a node already in the cluster.

Usage:
...............
add <node>
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_copy,Copy file to other cluster nodes]]
==== `copy`

Copy file to other cluster nodes.

Copies the given file to all other nodes unless given a
list of nodes to copy to as argument.

Usage:
...............
copy <filename> [nodes ...]
...............

Example:
...............
copy /etc/motd
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_diff,Diff file across cluster]]
==== `diff`

Displays the difference, if any, between a given file
on different nodes. If the second argument is `--checksum`,
a checksum of the file will be calculated and displayed for
each node.

Usage:
...............
diff <file> [--checksum] [nodes...]
...............

Example:
...............
diff /etc/crm/crm.conf node2
diff /etc/resolv.conf --checksum
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_health,Cluster health check]]
==== `health`

Runs a larger set of tests and queries on all nodes in the cluster to
verify the general system health and detect potential problems.

Usage:
...............
health
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_init,Initializes a new HA cluster]]
==== `init`

Installs and configures a basic HA cluster on a set of nodes.

Usage:
........
init node1 node2 node3
init --dry-run node1 node2 node3
........

[[cmdhelp_cluster_remove,Remove a node from the cluster]]
==== `remove`

This command simplifies the process of removing a node from the
cluster, moving any resources hosted by that node to other nodes.

Usage:
...............
remove <node>
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_run,Execute an arbitrary command on all nodes]]
==== `run`

This command takes a shell statement as argument, executes that
statement on all nodes in the cluster, and reports the result.

Usage:
...............
run <command>
...............

Example:
...............
run "cat /proc/uptime"
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_start,Start cluster services]]
==== `start`

Starts the cluster-related system services on this node.

Usage:
.........
start
.........

[[cmdhelp_cluster_status,Cluster status check]]
==== `status`

Reports the status for the cluster messaging layer on the local
node.

Usage:
...............
status
...............

[[cmdhelp_cluster_stop,Stop cluster services]]
==== `stop`

Stops the cluster-related system services on this node.

Usage:
.........
stop
.........

[[cmdhelp_cluster_wait_for_startup,Wait for cluster to start]]
==== `wait_for_startup`

Mostly useful in scripts or automated workflows, this command will
attempt to connect to the local cluster node repeatedly. The command
will keep trying until the cluster node responds, or the `timeout`
elapses. The timeout can be changed by supplying a value in seconds as
an argument.

Usage:
........
wait_for_startup
........

[[cmdhelp_script,Cluster script management]]
=== `script` - Cluster script management

A big part of the configuration and management of a cluster is
collecting information about all cluster nodes and deploying changes
to those nodes. Often, just performing the same procedure on all nodes
will encounter problems, due to subtle differences in the
configuration.

For example, when configuring a cluster for the first time, the
software needs to be installed and configured on all nodes before the
cluster software can be launched and configured using `crmsh`. This
process is cumbersome and error-prone, and the goal is for scripts to
make this process easier.

Scripts are implemented using the python `parallax` package which
provides a thin wrapper on top of SSH. This allows the scripts to
function through the usual SSH channels used for system maintenance,
requiring no additional software to be installed or maintained.

[[cmdhelp_script_json,JSON API for cluster scripts]]
==== `json`

This command provides a JSON API for the cluster scripts, intended for
use in user interface tools that want to interact with the cluster via
scripts.

The command takes a single argument, which should be a JSON array with
the first member identifying the command to perform.

The output is line-based: Commands that return multiple results will
return them line-by-line, ending with a terminator value: "end".

When providing parameter values to this command, they should be
provided as nested objects, so +virtual-ip:ip=192.168.0.5+ on the
command line becomes the JSON object
+{"virtual-ip":{"ip":"192.168.0.5"}}+.

API:
........
["list"]
=> [{name, shortdesc, category}]

["show", <name>]
=> [{name, shortdesc, longdesc, category, <<steps>>}]

<<steps>> := [{name, shortdesc], longdesc, required, parameters, steps}]

<<params>> := [{name, shortdesc, longdesc, required, unique, advanced,
                type, value, example}]

["verify", <name>, <<values>>]
=> [{shortdesc, longdesc, text, nodes}]

["run", <name>, <<values>>]
=> [{shortdesc, rc, output|error}]
........


[[cmdhelp_script_list,List available scripts]]
==== `list`

Lists the available scripts, sorted by category. Scripts that have the
special `Script` category are hidden by default, since they are mainly
used by other scripts or commands. To also show these, pass `all` as
argument.

To get a flat list of script names, not sorted by category, pass
`names` as an extra argument.

Usage:
............
list [all] [names]
............

Example:
............
list
list all names
............

[[cmdhelp_script_run,Run the script]]
==== `run`

Given a list of parameter values, this command will execute the
actions specified by the cluster script. The format for the parameter
values is the same as for the `verify` command.

Can optionally take at least two parameters:
* `nodes=<nodes>`: List of nodes that the script runs over
* `dry_run=yes|no`: If set, the script will not perform any modifications.

Additional parameters may be available depending on the script.

Use the `show` command to see what parameters are available.

Usage:
.............
run <script> [args...]
.............

Example:
.............
run apache install=true
run sbd id=sbd-1 node=node1 sbd_device=/dev/disk/by-uuid/F00D-CAFE
.............

[[cmdhelp_script_show,Describe the script]]
==== `show`

Prints a description and short summary of the script, with
descriptions of the accepted parameters.

Advanced parameters are hidden by default. To show the complete list
of parameters accepted by the script, pass `all` as argument.

Usage:
............
show <script> [all]
............

Example:
............
show virtual-ip
............

[[cmdhelp_script_verify,Verify the script]]
==== `verify`

Checks the given parameter values, and returns a list
of actions that will be executed when running the script
if provided the same list of parameter values.

Usage:
............
verify <script> [args...]
............

Example:
............
verify sbd id=sbd-1 node=node1 sbd_device=/dev/disk/by-uuid/F00D-CAFE
............

[[cmdhelp_corosync,Corosync management]]
=== `corosync` - Corosync management

Corosync is the underlying messaging layer for most HA clusters.
This level provides commands for editing and managing the corosync
configuration.

[[cmdhelp_corosync_add-node,Add a corosync node]]
==== `add-node`

Adds a node to the corosync configuration. This is used with the `udpu`
type configuration in corosync.

A nodeid for the added node is generated automatically.

Note that this command assumes that only a single ring is used, and
sets only the address for ring0.

Usage:
.........
add-node <addr> [name]
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_del-node,Remove a corosync node]]
==== `del-node`

Removes a node from the corosync configuration. The argument given is
the `ring0_addr` address set in the configuration file.

Usage:
.........
del-node <addr>
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_diff,Diffs the corosync configuration]]
==== `diff`

Diffs the corosync configurations on different nodes. If no nodes are
given as arguments, the corosync configurations on all nodes in the
cluster are compared.

`diff` takes an option argument `--checksum`, to display a checksum
for each file instead of calculating a diff.

Usage:
.........
diff [--checksum] [node...]
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_edit,Edit the corosync configuration]]
==== `edit`

Opens the Corosync configuration file in an editor.

Usage:
.........
edit
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_get,Get a corosync configuration value]]
==== `get`

Returns the value configured in `corosync.conf`, which is not
necessarily the value used in the running configuration. See `reload`
for telling corosync about configuration changes.

The argument is the complete dot-separated path to the value.

If there are multiple values configured with the same path, the
command returns all values for that path. For example, to get all
configured `ring0_addr` values, use this command:

Example:
........
get nodelist.node.ring0_addr
........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_log,Show the corosync log file]]
==== `log`

Opens the log file specified in the corosync configuration file. If no
log file is configured, this command returns an error.

The pager used can be configured either using the PAGER
environment variable or in `crm.conf`.

Usage:
.........
log
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_pull,Pulls the corosync configuration]]
==== `pull`

Gets the corosync configuration from another node and copies
it to this node.

Usage:
.........
pull <node>
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_push,Push the corosync configuration]]
==== `push`

Pushes the corosync configuration file on this node to
the list of nodes provided. If no target nodes are given,
the configuration is pushed to all other nodes in the cluster.

It is recommended to use `csync2` to distribute the cluster
configuration files rather than relying on this command.

Usage:
.........
push [node] ...
.........

Example:
.........
push node-2 node-3
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_reload,Reload the corosync configuration]]
==== `reload`

Tells all instances of corosync in this cluster to reload
`corosync.conf`.

After pushing a new configuration to all cluster nodes, call this
command to make corosync use the new configuration.

Usage:
.........
reload
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_set,Set a corosync configuration value]]
==== `set`

Sets the value identified by the given path. If the value does not
exist in the configuration file, it will be added. However, if the
section containing the value does not exist, the command will fail.

Usage:
.........
set quorum.expected_votes 2
.........

[[cmdhelp_corosync_show,Display the corosync configuration]]
==== `show`

Displays the corosync configuration on the current node.

.........
show

[[cmdhelp_cib,CIB shadow management]]
=== `cib` - CIB shadow management

This level is for management of shadow CIBs. It is available both
at the top level and the `configure` level.

All the commands are implemented using `cib_shadow(8)` and the
`CIB_shadow` environment variable. The user prompt always
includes the name of the currently active shadow or the live CIB.

[[cmdhelp_cib_cibstatus,CIB status management and editing]]
==== `cibstatus`

Enter edit and manage the CIB status section level. See the
<<cmdhelp_cibstatus,CIB status management section>>.

[[cmdhelp_cib_commit,copy a shadow CIB to the cluster]]
==== `commit`

Apply a shadow CIB to the cluster. If the shadow name is omitted
then the current shadow CIB is applied.

Temporary shadow CIBs are removed automatically on commit.

Usage:
...............
commit [<cib>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_delete,delete a shadow CIB]]
==== `delete`

Delete an existing shadow CIB.

Usage:
...............
delete <cib>
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_diff,diff between the shadow CIB and the live CIB]]
==== `diff`

Print differences between the current cluster configuration and
the active shadow CIB.

Usage:
...............
diff
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_import,import a CIB or PE input file to a shadow]]
==== `import`

At times it may be useful to create a shadow file from the
existing CIB. The CIB may be specified as file or as a PE input
file number. The shell will look up files in the local directory
first and then in the PE directory (typically `/var/lib/pengine`).
Once the CIB file is found, it is copied to a shadow and this
shadow is immediately available for use at both `configure` and
`cibstatus` levels.

If the shadow name is omitted then the target shadow is named
after the input CIB file.

Note that there are often more than one PE input file, so you may
need to specify the full name.

Usage:
...............
import {<file>|<number>} [<shadow>]
...............
Examples:
...............
import pe-warn-2222
import 2289 issue2
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_list,list all shadow CIBs]]
==== `list`

List existing shadow CIBs.

Usage:
...............
list
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_new,create a new shadow CIB]]
==== `new`

Create a new shadow CIB. The live cluster configuration and
status is copied to the shadow CIB.

If the name of the shadow is omitted, we create a temporary CIB
shadow. It is useful if multiple level sessions are desired
without affecting the cluster. A temporary CIB shadow is short
lived and will be removed either on `commit` or on program exit.
Note that if the temporary shadow is not committed all changes in
the temporary shadow are lost.

Specify `withstatus` if you want to edit the status section of
the shadow CIB (see the <<cmdhelp_cibstatus,cibstatus section>>).
Add `force` to force overwriting the existing shadow CIB.

To start with an empty configuration that is not copied from the live
CIB, specify the `empty` keyword. (This also allows a shadow CIB to be
created in case no cluster is running.)

Usage:
...............
new [<cib>] [withstatus] [force] [empty]
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_reset,copy live cib to a shadow CIB]]
==== `reset`

Copy the current cluster configuration into the shadow CIB.

Usage:
...............
reset <cib>
...............

[[cmdhelp_cib_use,change working CIB]]
==== `use`

Choose a CIB source. If you want to edit the status from the
shadow CIB specify `withstatus` (see <<cmdhelp_cibstatus,`cibstatus`>>).
Leave out the CIB name to switch to the running CIB.

Usage:
...............
use [<cib>] [withstatus]
...............

[[cmdhelp_ra,Resource Agents (RA) lists and documentation]]
=== `ra` - Resource Agents (RA) lists and documentation

can find information on how to use a resource agent. It is also
possible to get information from some programs: `pengine`,
`crmd`, `cib`, and `stonithd`. Just specify the program name
instead of an RA.

Usage:
...............
info [<class>:[<provider>:]]<type>
info <type> <class> [<provider>] (obsolete)
...............
Example:

as argument, the resource is banned from the current location.

See `move` for details on other arguments.

Usage:
...............
ban <rsc> [<node>] [<lifetime>] [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_cleanup,cleanup resource status]]
==== `cleanup`

Cleanup resource status. Typically done after the resource has
temporarily failed. If a node is omitted, cleanup on all nodes.
If there are many nodes, the command may take a while.

+(Pacemaker 1.1.14)+ Pass force to cleanup the resource itself,
otherwise the cleanup command will apply to the parent resource (if
any).

maintenance rsc1
maintenance rsc2 off
..................

[[cmdhelp_resource_manage,put a resource into managed mode]]
==== `manage`

Manage a resource using the `is-managed` attribute. If there
are multiple meta attributes sets, the attribute is set in all of
them. If the resource is a clone, all `is-managed` attributes are

[[cmdhelp_resource_move,Move a resource to another node]]
==== `move` (`migrate`)

Move a resource away from its current location.

If the destination node is left out, the resource is migrated by
creating a constraint which prevents it from running on the current
node. For this type of constraint to be created, the +force+ argument
is required.

A lifetime may be given for the constraint. Once it expires, the
location constraint will no longer be active.

an alias for `cleanup`.
****************************

Usage:
...............
reprobe [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_restart,restart resources]]
==== `restart`

Restart one or more resources. This is essentially a shortcut for
resource stop followed by a start. The shell is first going to wait
for the stop to finish, that is for all resources to really stop, and
only then to order the start action. Due to this command
entailing a whole set of operations, informational messages are
printed to let the user see some progress.

For details on group management see
<<cmdhelp_options_manage-children,`options manage-children`>>.

Usage:
...............
restart <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
...............
Example:

Display the allocation scores for all resources.

Usage:
................
scores
................

[[cmdhelp_resource_secret,manage sensitive parameters]]
==== `secret`

Sensitive parameters can be kept in local files rather than CIB
in order to prevent accidental data exposure. Use the `secret`
command to manage such parameters. `stash` and `unstash` move the
value from the CIB and back to the CIB respectively. The `set`
subcommand sets the parameter to the provided value. `delete`
removes the parameter completely. `show` displays the value of
the parameter from the local file. Use `check` to verify if the
local file content is valid.

Usage:
...............
secret <rsc> set <param> <value>
secret <rsc> stash <param>
secret <rsc> unstash <param>
secret <rsc> delete <param>
secret <rsc> show <param>

secret fence_1 show password
secret fence_1 stash password
secret fence_1 set password secret_value
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_start,start resources]]
==== `start`

Start one or more resources by setting the `target-role` attribute. If
there are multiple meta attributes sets, the attribute is set in all
of them. If the resource is a clone, all `target-role` attributes are
removed from the children resources.

For details on group management see
<<cmdhelp_options_manage-children,`options manage-children`>>.

Usage:
...............
start <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_status,show status of resources]]
==== `status` (`show`, `list`)

Print resource status. More than one resource can be shown at once. If
the resource parameter is left out, the status of all resources is
printed.

Usage:
...............
status [<rsc> ...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_stop,stop resources]]
==== `stop`

Stop one or more resources using the `target-role` attribute. If there
are multiple meta attributes sets, the attribute is set in all of
them. If the resource is a clone, all `target-role` attributes are
removed from the children resources.

For details on group management see
<<cmdhelp_options_manage-children,`options manage-children`>>.

Usage:
...............
stop <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_trace,start RA tracing]]
==== `trace`

Start tracing RA for the given operation. The trace files are
stored in `$HA_VARLIB/trace_ra`. If the operation to be traced is
monitor, note that the number of trace files can grow very
quickly.

If no operation name is given, crmsh will attempt to trace all
operations for the RA. This includes any configured operations, start
and stop as well as promote/demote for multistate resources.

To trace the probe operation which exists for all resources, either
set a trace for `monitor` with interval `0`, or use `probe` as the
operation name.

Usage:
...............
trace <rsc> [<op> [<interval>] ]
...............
Example:
...............
trace fs start
trace webserver
trace webserver probe
trace fs monitor 0
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_unmanage,put a resource into unmanaged mode]]
==== `unmanage`

Unmanage a resource using the `is-managed` attribute. If there
are multiple meta attributes sets, the attribute is set in all of
them. If the resource is a clone, all `is-managed` attributes are
removed from the children resources.

For details on group management see <<cmdhelp_options_manage-children,`options manage-children`>>.

Usage:
...............
unmanage <rsc>
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_untrace,stop RA tracing]]
==== `untrace`

Stop tracing RA for the given operation. If no operation name is
given, crmsh will attempt to stop tracing all operations in resource.

Usage:
...............
untrace <rsc> [<op> [<interval>] ]
...............
Example:
...............
untrace fs start
untrace webserver
...............

[[cmdhelp_resource_utilization,manage a utilization attribute]]
==== `utilization`

Show/edit/delete a utilization attribute of a resource. These
attributes describe hardware requirements. By setting the
`placement-strategy` cluster property appropriately, it is
possible then to distribute resources based on resource
requirements and node size. See also <<cmdhelp_node_utilization,node utilization attributes>>.

Usage:
...............
utilization <rsc> set <attr> <value>
utilization <rsc> delete <attr>
utilization <rsc> show <attr>
...............
Example:
...............
utilization xen1 set memory 4096
...............

[[cmdhelp_node,Node management]]
=== `node` - Node management

Node management and status commands.

[[cmdhelp_node_attribute,manage attributes]]
==== `attribute`

Edit node attributes. This kind of attribute should refer to
relatively static properties, such as memory size.

Usage:
...............
attribute <node> set <attr> <value>
attribute <node> delete <attr>
attribute <node> show <attr>
...............
Example:
...............
attribute node_1 set memory_size 4096
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_clearstate,Clear node state]]
==== `clearstate`

Resets and clears the state of the specified node. This node is
afterwards assumed clean and offline. This command can be used to
manually confirm that a node has been fenced (e.g., powered off).

Be careful! This can cause data corruption if you confirm that a node is
down that is, in fact, not cleanly down - the cluster will proceed as if
the fence had succeeded, possibly starting resources multiple times.

Usage:
...............
clearstate <node>
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_delete,delete node]]
==== `delete`

Delete a node. This command will remove the node from the CIB
and, in case the cluster stack is running, use the appropriate
program (`crm_node` or `hb_delnode`) to remove the node from the
membership.

If the node is still listed as active and a member of our
partition we refuse to remove it. With the global force option
(`-F`) we will try to delete the node anyway.

Usage:
...............
delete <node>
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_fence,fence node]]
==== `fence`

Make CRM fence a node. This functionality depends on stonith
resources capable of fencing the specified node. No such stonith
resources, no fencing will happen.

Usage:
...............
fence <node>
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_maintenance,put node into maintenance mode]]
==== `maintenance`

Set the node status to maintenance. This is equivalent to the
cluster-wide `maintenance-mode` property but puts just one node
into the maintenance mode.

The node parameter defaults to the node where the command is run.

Usage:
...............
maintenance [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_online,set node online]]
==== `online`

Set a node to online status.

The node parameter defaults to the node where the command is run.

Usage:
...............
online [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_ready,put node into ready mode]]
==== `ready`

Set the node's maintenance status to `off`. The node should be
now again fully operational and capable of running resource
operations.

The node parameter defaults to the node where the command is run.

Usage:
...............
ready [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_server,show node hostname or server address]]
==== `server`

Remote nodes may have a configured server address which should
be used when contacting the node. This command prints the
server address if configured, else the node name.

If no parameter is given, the adresses or names for all nodes
are printed.

Usage:
...............
server [<node> ...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_show,show node]]
==== `show`

Show a node definition. If the node parameter is omitted then all
nodes are shown.

Usage:
...............
show [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_standby,put node into standby]]
==== `standby`

Set a node to standby status. The node parameter defaults to the
node where the command is run.

Additionally, you may specify a lifetime for the standby---if set to
`reboot`, the node will be back online once it reboots. `forever` will
keep the node in standby after reboot. The life time defaults to
`forever`.

Usage:
...............
standby [<node>] [<lifetime>]

lifetime :: reboot | forever
...............

Example:
...............
standby bob reboot
...............


[[cmdhelp_node_status,show nodes' status as XML]]
==== `status`

Show nodes' status as XML. If the node parameter is omitted then
all nodes are shown.

Usage:
...............
status [<node>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_status-attr,manage status attributes]]
==== `status-attr`

Edit node attributes which are in the CIB status section, i.e.
attributes which hold properties of a more volatile nature. One
typical example is attribute generated by the `pingd` utility.

Usage:
...............
status-attr <node> set <attr> <value>
status-attr <node> delete <attr>
status-attr <node> show <attr>
...............
Example:
...............
status-attr node_1 show pingd
...............

[[cmdhelp_node_utilization,manage utilization attributes]]
==== `utilization`

Edit node utilization attributes. These attributes describe
hardware characteristics as integer numbers such as memory size
or the number of CPUs. By setting the `placement-strategy`
cluster property appropriately, it is possible then to distribute
resources based on resource requirements and node size. See also
<<cmdhelp_resource_utilization,resource utilization attributes>>.

Usage:
...............
utilization <node> set <attr> <value>
utilization <node> delete <attr>
utilization <node> show <attr>
...............
Examples:
...............
utilization node_1 set memory 16384
utilization node_1 show cpu
...............

[[cmdhelp_site,GEO clustering site support]]
=== `site` - GEO clustering site support

A cluster may consist of two or more subclusters in different and
distant locations. This set of commands supports such setups.

[[cmdhelp_site_ticket,manage site tickets]]
==== `ticket`

Tickets are cluster-wide attributes. They can be managed at the
site where this command is executed.

It is then possible to constrain resources depending on the
ticket availability (see the <<cmdhelp_configure_rsc_ticket,`rsc_ticket`>> command
for more details).

Usage:
...............
ticket {grant|revoke|standby|activate|show|time|delete} <ticket>
...............
Example:
...............
ticket grant ticket1
...............

[[cmdhelp_options,User preferences]]
=== `options` - User preferences

The user may set various options for the crm shell itself.

[[cmdhelp_options_add-quotes,add quotes around parameters containing spaces]]
==== `add-quotes`

The shell (as in `/bin/sh`) parser strips quotes from the command
line. This may sometimes make it really difficult to type values
which contain white space. One typical example is the configure
filter command. The crm shell will supply extra quotes around
arguments which contain white space. The default is `yes`.

.Note on quotes use
****************************
Adding quotes around arguments automatically has been introduced
with version 1.2.2 and it is technically a regression. Being a
regression is the only reason the `add-quotes` option exists. If
you have custom shell scripts which would break, just set the
`add-quotes` option to `no`.

For instance, with adding quotes enabled, it is possible to do
the following:
...............
# crm configure primitive d1 Dummy \
    meta description="some description here"
# crm configure filter 'sed "s/hostlist=./&node-c /"' fencing
...............
****************************

[[cmdhelp_options_check-frequency,when to perform semantic check]]
==== `check-frequency`

Semantic check of the CIB or elements modified or created may be
done on every configuration change (`always`), when verifying
(`on-verify`) or `never`. It is by default set to `always`.
Experts may want to change the setting to `on-verify`.

The checks require that resource agents are present. If they are
not installed at the configuration time set this preference to
`never`.

See <<topics_Features_Checks,Configuration semantic checks>> for more details.

[[cmdhelp_options_check-mode,how to treat semantic errors]]
==== `check-mode`

Semantic check of the CIB or elements modified or created may be
done in the `strict` mode or in the `relaxed` mode. In the former
certain problems are treated as configuration errors. In the
`relaxed` mode all are treated as warnings. The default is `strict`.

See <<topics_Features_Checks,Configuration semantic checks>> for more details.

[[cmdhelp_options_colorscheme,set colors for output]]
==== `colorscheme`

With `output` set to `color`, a comma separated list of colors
from this option are used to emphasize:

- keywords
- object ids
- attribute names
- attribute values
- scores
- resource references

`crm` can show colors only if there is curses support for python
installed (usually provided by the `python-curses` package). The
colors are whatever is available in your terminal. Use `normal`
if you want to keep the default foreground color.

This user preference defaults to
`yellow,normal,cyan,red,green,magenta` which is good for
terminals with dark background. You may want to change the color
scheme and save it in the preferences file for other color
setups.

Example:
...............
colorscheme yellow,normal,blue,red,green,magenta
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_editor,set preferred editor program]]
==== `editor`

The `edit` command invokes an editor. Use this to specify your
preferred editor program. If not set, it will default to either
the value of the `EDITOR` environment variable or to one of the
standard UNIX editors (`vi`,`emacs`,`nano`).

Usage:
...............
editor program
...............
Example:
...............
editor vim
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_manage-children,how to handle children resource attributes]]
==== `manage-children`

Some resource management commands, such as `resource stop`, when
the target resource is a group, may not always produce desired
result. Each element, group and the primitive members, can have a
meta attribute and those attributes may end up with conflicting
values. Consider the following construct:
...............
crm(live)# configure show svc fs virtual-ip
primitive fs Filesystem \
    params device="/dev/drbd0" directory="/srv/nfs" fstype=ext3 \
    op monitor interval=10s \
    meta target-role=Started
primitive virtual-ip IPaddr2 \
    params ip=10.2.13.110 iflabel=1 \
    op monitor interval=10s \
    op start interval=0 \
    meta target-role=Started
group svc fs virtual-ip \
    meta target-role=Stopped
...............

Even though the element +svc+ should be stopped, the group is
actually running because all its members have the +target-role+
set to +Started+:
...............
crm(live)# resource show svc
resource svc is running on: xen-f
...............

Hence, if the user invokes +resource stop svc+ the intention is
not clear. This preference gives the user an opportunity to
better control what happens if attributes of group members have
values which are in conflict with the same attribute of the group
itself.

Possible values are +ask+ (the default), +always+, and +never+.
If set to +always+, the crm shell removes all children attributes
which have values different from the parent. If set to +never+,
all children attributes are left intact. Finally, if set to
+ask+, the user will be asked for each member what is to be done.

[[cmdhelp_options_output,set output type]]
==== `output`

`crm` can adorn configurations in two ways: in color (similar to
for instance the `ls --color` command) and by showing keywords in
upper case. Possible values are `plain`, `color-always`, `color`,
and 'uppercase'. It is possible to combine `uppercase` with one
of the color values in order to get an upper case xmass tree. Just
set this option to `color,uppercase` or `color-always,uppercase`.
In case you need color codes in pipes, `color-always` forces color
codes even in case the terminal is not a tty (just like `ls
--color=always`).

[[cmdhelp_options_pager,set preferred pager program]]
==== `pager`

The `view` command displays text through a pager. Use this to
specify your preferred pager program. If not set, it will default
to either the value of the `PAGER` environment variable or to one
of the standard UNIX system pagers (`less`,`more`,`pg`).

[[cmdhelp_options_reset,reset user preferences to factory defaults]]
==== `reset`

This command resets all user options to the defaults. If used as
a single-shot command, the rc file (+$HOME/.config/crm/rc+) is
reset to the defaults too.

[[cmdhelp_options_save,save the user preferences to the rc file]]
==== `save`

Save current settings to the rc file (+$HOME/.config/crm/rc+). On
further `crm` runs, the rc file is automatically read and parsed.

[[cmdhelp_options_set,Set the value of a given option]]
==== `set`

Sets the value of an option. Takes the fully qualified
name of the option as argument, as displayed by +show all+.

The modified option value is stored in the user-local
configuration file, usually found in +~/.config/crm/crm.conf+.

Usage:
........
set <option> <value>
........

Example:
........
set color.warn "magenta bold"
set editor nano
........

[[cmdhelp_options_show,show current user preference]]
==== `show`

Display all current settings.

Given an option name as argument, `show` will display only the value
of that argument.

Given +all+ as argument, `show` displays all available user options.

Usage:
........
show [all|<option>]
........

Example:
........
show
show skill-level
show all
........

[[cmdhelp_options_skill-level,set skill level]]
==== `skill-level`

Based on the skill-level setting, the user is allowed to use only
a subset of commands. There are three levels: operator,
administrator, and expert. The operator level allows only
commands at the `resource` and `node` levels, but not editing
or deleting resources. The administrator may do that and may also
configure the cluster at the `configure` level and manage the
shadow CIBs. The expert may do all.

Usage:
...............
skill-level <level>

level :: operator | administrator | expert
...............

.Note on security
****************************
The `skill-level` option is advisory only. There is nothing
stopping any users change their skill level (see
<<topics_Features_Security,Access Control Lists (ACL)>> on how to enforce
access control).
****************************

[[cmdhelp_options_sort-elements,sort CIB elements]]
==== `sort-elements`

`crm` by default sorts CIB elements. If you want them appear in
the order they were created, set this option to `no`.

Usage:
...............
sort-elements {yes|no}
...............
Example:
...............
sort-elements no
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_user,set the cluster user]]
==== `user`

Sufficient privileges are necessary in order to manage a
cluster: programs such as `crm_verify` or `crm_resource` and,
ultimately, `cibadmin` have to be run either as `root` or as the
CRM owner user (typically `hacluster`). You don't have to worry
about that if you run `crm` as `root`. A more secure way is to
run the program with your usual privileges, set this option to
the appropriate user (such as `hacluster`), and setup the
`sudoers` file.

Usage:
...............
user system-user
...............
Example:
...............
user hacluster
...............

[[cmdhelp_options_wait,synchronous operation]]
==== `wait`

In normal operation, `crm` runs a command and gets back
immediately to process other commands or get input from the user.
With this option set to `yes` it will wait for the started
transition to finish. In interactive mode dots are printed to
indicate progress.

Usage:
...............
wait {yes|no}
...............
Example:
...............
wait yes
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure,CIB configuration]]
=== `configure` - CIB configuration

This level enables all CIB object definition commands.

The configuration may be logically divided into four parts:
nodes, resources, constraints, and (cluster) properties and
attributes.  Each of these commands support one or more basic CIB
objects.

Nodes and attributes describing nodes are managed using the
`node` command.

Commands for resources are:

- `primitive`
- `monitor`
- `group`
- `clone`
- `ms`/`master` (master-slave)

In order to streamline large configurations, it is possible to
define a template which can later be referenced in primitives:

- `rsc_template`

In that case the primitive inherits all attributes defined in the
template.

There are three types of constraints:

- `location`
- `colocation`
- `order`

It is possible to define fencing order (stonith resource
priorities):

- `fencing_topology`

Finally, there are the cluster properties, resource meta
attributes defaults, and operations defaults. All are just a set
of attributes. These attributes are managed by the following
commands:

- `property`
- `rsc_defaults`
- `op_defaults`

In addition to the cluster configuration, the Access Control
Lists (ACL) can be setup to allow access to parts of the CIB for
users other than +root+ and +hacluster+. The following commands
manage ACL:

- `user`
- `role`

In Pacemaker 1.1.12 and up, this command replaces the `user` command
for handling ACLs:

- `acl_target`

The changes are applied to the current CIB only on ending the
configuration session or using the `commit` command.

Comments start with +#+ in the first line. The comments are tied
to the element which follows. If the element moves, its comments
will follow.

[[cmdhelp_configure_acl_target,Define target access rights]]
==== `acl_target`

Defines an ACL target.

Usage:
................
acl_target <tid> [<role> ...]
................
Example:
................
acl_target joe resource_admin constraint_editor
................

[[cmdhelp_configure_alert,Event-driven alerts]]
==== `alert`

.Version note
****************************
This feature is only available
in Pacemaker 1.1.15+.
****************************

Event-driven alerts enables calling scripts whenever interesting
events occur in the cluster (nodes joining or leaving, resources
starting or stopping, etc.).

The +path+ is an arbitrary file path to an alert script.  Existing
external scripts used with ClusterMon resources can be used as alert
scripts, since the interface is compatible.

Each alert may have a number of receipients configured.  These will be
passed to the script as arguments. The first recipient will also be
passed as the +CRM_alert_recipient+ environment variable, for
compatibility with existing scripts that only support one recipient.

The available meta attributes are +timeout+ (default 30s) and
+timestamp-format+ (default `"%H:%M:%S.%06N"`).

Some configurations may require each recipient to be delimited by
brackets, to avoid ambiguity. In the example +alert-2+ below, the meta
attribute for `timeout` is defined after the recipient, so the
brackets are used to ensure that the meta attribute is set for the
alert and not just the recipient. This can be avoided by setting any
alert attributes before defining the recipients.

Usage:
...............
alert <id> <path> \
  [attributes <nvpair> ...] \
  [meta <nvpair> ...] \
  [to [{] <recipient>
    [attributes <nvpair> ...] \
    [meta <nvpair> ...] [}] \
    ...]
...............

Example:
...............
alert alert-1 /srv/pacemaker/pcmk_alert_sample.sh \
    to /var/log/cluster-alerts.log

alert alert-2 /srv/pacemaker/example_alert.sh \
    to { /var/log/cluster-alerts.log } \
    meta timeout=60s
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_cib,CIB shadow management]]
==== `cib`

This level is for management of shadow CIBs. It is available at
the `configure` level to enable saving intermediate changes to a
shadow CIB instead of to the live cluster. This short excerpt
shows how:
...............
crm(live)configure# cib new test-2
INFO: test-2 shadow CIB created
crm(test-2)configure# commit
...............
Note how the current CIB in the prompt changed from +live+ to
+test-2+ after issuing the `cib new` command. See also the
<<cmdhelp_cib,CIB shadow management>> for more information.

[[cmdhelp_configure_cibstatus,CIB status management and editing]]
==== `cibstatus`

Enter edit and manage the CIB status section level. See the
<<cmdhelp_cibstatus,CIB status management section>>.

[[cmdhelp_configure_clone,define a clone]]
==== `clone`

The `clone` command creates a resource clone. It may contain a
single primitive resource or one group of resources.

Usage:
...............
clone <name> <rsc>
  [description=<description>]
  [meta <attr_list>]
  [params <attr_list>]

attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
clone cl_fence apc_1 \
  meta clone-node-max=1 globally-unique=false
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_colocation,colocate resources]]
==== `colocation` (`collocation`)

This constraint expresses the placement relation between two
or more resources. If there are more than two resources, then the
constraint is called a resource set.

The score is used to indicate the priority of the constraint. A
positive score indicates that the resources should run on the same
node. A negative score that they should not run on the same
node. Values of positive or negative +infinity+ indicate a mandatory
constraint.

In the two resource form, the cluster will place +<with-rsc>+ first,
and then decide where to put the +<rsc>+ resource.

Collocation resource sets have an extra attribute (+sequential+)
to allow for sets of resources which don't depend on each other
in terms of state. The shell syntax for such sets is to put
resources in parentheses.

Sets cannot be nested.

The optional +node-attribute+ can be used to colocate resources on a
set of nodes and not necessarily on the same node. For example, by
setting a node attribute +color+ on all nodes and setting the
+node-attribute+ value to +color+ as well, the colocated resources
will be placed on any node that has the same color.

For more details on how to configure resource sets, see
<<topics_Features_Resourcesets,`Syntax: Resource sets`>>.

Usage:
...............
colocation <id> <score>: <rsc>[:<role>] <with-rsc>[:<role>]
  [node-attribute=<node_attr>]

colocation <id> <score>: <resource_sets>
  [node-attribute=<node_attr>]

resource_sets :: <resource_set> [<resource_set> ...]

resource_set :: ["("|"["] <rsc>[:<role>] [<rsc>[:<role>] ...] \
                [<attributes>]  [")"|"]"]

attributes :: [require-all=(true|false)] [sequential=(true|false)]

...............
Example:
...............
colocation never_put_apache_with_dummy -inf: apache dummy
colocation c1 inf: A ( B C )
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_commit,commit the changes to the CIB]]
==== `commit`

Commit the current configuration to the CIB in use. As noted
elsewhere, commands in a configure session don't have immediate
effect on the CIB. All changes are applied at one point in time,
either using `commit` or when the user leaves the configure
level. In case the CIB in use changed in the meantime, presumably
by somebody else, the crm shell will refuse to apply the changes.

If you know that it's fine to still apply them, add +force+ to the
command line.

To disable CIB patching and apply the changes by replacing the CIB
completely, add +replace+ to the command line. Note that this can lead
to previous changes being overwritten if some other process
concurrently modifies the CIB.

Usage:
...............
commit [force] [replace]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_default-timeouts,set timeouts for operations to minimums from the meta-data]]
==== `default-timeouts`

This command takes the timeouts from the actions section of the
resource agent meta-data and sets them for the operations of the
primitive.

Usage:
...............
default-timeouts <id> [<id>...]
...............

.Note on `default-timeouts`
****************************
The use of this command is discouraged in favor of manually
determining the best timeouts required for the particular
configuration. Relying on the resource agent to supply appropriate
timeouts can cause the resource to fail at the worst possible moment.

Appropriate timeouts for resource actions are context-sensitive, and
should be carefully considered with the whole configuration in mind.
****************************

[[cmdhelp_configure_delete,delete CIB objects]]
==== `delete`

Delete one or more objects. If an object to be deleted belongs to
a container object, such as a group, and it is the only resource
in that container, then the container is deleted as well. Any
related constraints are removed as well.

If the object is a started resource, it will not be deleted unless the
+--force+ flag is passed to the command, or the +force+ option is set.

Usage:
...............
delete [--force] <id> [<id>...]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_edit,edit CIB objects]]
==== `edit`

This command invokes the editor with the object description. As
with the `show` command, the user may choose to edit all objects
or a set of objects.

If the user insists, he or she may edit the XML edition of the
object. If you do that, don't modify any id attributes.

Usage:
...............
edit [xml] [<id> ...]
edit [xml] changed
...............

.Note on renaming element ids
****************************
The edit command sometimes cannot properly handle modifying
element ids. In particular for elements which belong to group or
ms resources. Group and ms resources themselves also cannot be
renamed. Please use the `rename` command instead.
****************************

[[cmdhelp_configure_erase,erase the CIB]]
==== `erase`

The `erase` clears all configuration. Apart from nodes. To remove
nodes, you have to specify an additional keyword `nodes`.

Note that removing nodes from the live cluster may have some
strange/interesting/unwelcome effects.

Usage:
...............
erase [nodes]
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_fencing_topology,node fencing order]]
==== `fencing_topology`

If multiple fencing (stonith) devices are available capable of
fencing a node, their order may be specified by +fencing_topology+.
The order is specified per node.

Stonith resources can be separated by +,+ in which case all of
them need to succeed. If they fail, the next stonith resource (or
set of resources) is used. In other words, use comma to separate
resources which all need to succeed and whitespace for serial
order. It is not allowed to use whitespace around comma.

If the node is left out, the order is used for all nodes.
That should reduce the configuration size in some stonith setups.

From Pacemaker version 1.1.14, it is possible to use a node attribute
as the +target+ in a fencing topology. The syntax for this usage is
described below.

Usage:
...............
fencing_topology <stonith_resources> [<stonith_resources> ...]
fencing_topology <fencing_order> [<fencing_order> ...]

fencing_order :: <target> <stonith_resources> [<stonith_resources> ...]

stonith_resources :: <rsc>[,<rsc>...]
target :: <node>: | attr:<node-attribute>=<value>
...............
Example:
...............
# Only kill the power if poison-pill fails
fencing_topology poison-pill power

# As above for node-a, but a different strategy for node-b
fencing_topology \
    node-a: poison-pill power \

[[cmdhelp_configure_filter,filter CIB objects]]
==== `filter`

This command filters the given CIB elements through an external
program. The program should accept input on `stdin` and send
output to `stdout` (the standard UNIX filter conventions). As
with the `show` command, the user may choose to filter all or
just a subset of elements.

It is possible to filter the XML representation of objects, but
probably not as useful as the configuration language. The
presentation is somewhat different from what would be displayed
by the `show` command---each element is shown on a single line,
i.e. there are no backslashes and no other embelishments.

Don't forget to put quotes around the filter if it contains
spaces.

Usage:
...............
filter <prog> [xml] [<id> ...]
filter <prog> [xml] changed
...............
Examples:
...............
filter "sed '/^primitive/s/target-role=[^ ]*//'"
# crm configure filter "sed '/^primitive/s/target-role=[^ ]*//'"
crm configure <<END
  filter "sed '/threshold=\"1\"/s/=\"1\"/=\"0\"/g'"
END
...............

.Note on quotation marks
**************************
Filter commands which feature a blend of quotation marks can be
difficult to get right, especially when used directly from bash, since
bash does its own quotation parsing. In these cases, it can be easier
to supply the filter command as standard input. See the last example
above.
**************************

[[cmdhelp_configure_get_property,Get property value]]
==== `get-property`

Show the value of the given property. If the value is not set, the
command will print the default value for the property, if known.

If no property name is passed to the command, the list of known
cluster properties is printed.

If the property is set multiple times, for example using multiple
property sets with different rule expressions, the output of this
command is undefined.

Pass the argument +-t+ or +--true+ to `get-property` to translate
the argument value into +true+ or +false+. If the value is not
set, the command will print +false+.

Usage:
...............
get-property [-t|--true] [<name>]
...............

Example:
...............
get-property stonith-enabled
get-property -t maintenance-mode
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_graph,generate a directed graph]]
==== `graph`

Create a graphviz graphical layout from the current cluster
configuration.

Currently, only `dot` (directed graph) is supported. It is
essentially a visualization of resource ordering.

The graph may be saved to a file which can be used as source for
various graphviz tools (by default it is displayed in the user's
X11 session). Optionally, by specifying the format, one can also
produce an image instead.

For more or different graphviz attributes, it is possible to save
the default set of attributes to an ini file. If this file exists
it will always override the builtin settings. The +exportsettings+
subcommand also prints the location of the ini file.

Usage:
...............
graph [<gtype> [<file> [<img_format>]]]
graph exportsettings

gtype :: dot
img_format :: `dot` output format (see the +-T+ option)
...............
Example:
...............
graph dot
graph dot clu1.conf.dot
graph dot clu1.conf.svg svg
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_group,define a group]]
==== `group`

The `group` command creates a group of resources. This can be useful
when resources depend on other resources and require that those
resources start in order on the same node. A commmon use of resource
groups is to ensure that a server and a virtual IP are located
together, and that the virtual IP is started before the server.

Grouped resources are started in the order they appear in the group,
and stopped in the reverse order. If a resource in the group cannot
run anywhere, resources following it in the group will not start.

`group` can be passed the "container" meta attribute, to indicate that
it is to be used to group VM resources monitored using Nagios. The
resource referred to by the container attribute must be of type
`ocf:heartbeat:Xen`, `oxf:heartbeat:VirtualDomain` or `ocf:heartbeat:lxc`.

Usage:
...............
group <name> <rsc> [<rsc>...]
  [description=<description>]
  [meta attr_list]
  [params attr_list]

attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
group internal_www disk0 fs0 internal_ip apache \
  meta target_role=stopped

group vm-and-services vm vm-sshd meta container="vm"
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_load,import the CIB from a file]]
==== `load`

Load a part of configuration (or all of it) from a local file or
a network URL. The +replace+ method replaces the current
configuration with the one from the source. The +update+ method
tries to import the contents into the current configuration. The
+push+ method imports the contents into the current configuration
and removes any lines that are not present in the given
configuration.
The file may be a CLI file or an XML file.

If the URL is `-`, the configuration is read from standard input.

Usage:
...............
load [xml] <method> URL

method :: replace | update | push
...............
Example:
...............
load xml update myfirstcib.xml
load xml replace http://storage.big.com/cibs/bigcib.xml
load xml push smallcib.xml
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_location,a location preference]]
==== `location`

`location` defines the preference of nodes for the given
resource. The location constraints consist of one or more rules
which specify a score to be awarded if the rule matches.

The resource referenced by the location constraint can be one of the
following:

* Plain resource reference: +location loc1 webserver 100: node1+
* Resource set in curly brackets: +location loc1 { virtual-ip webserver } 100: node1+
* Tag containing resource ids: +location loc1 tag1 100: node1+
* Resource pattern: +location loc1 /web.*/ 100: node1+

The +resource-discovery+ attribute allows probes to be selectively
enabled or disabled per resource and node.

The syntax for resource sets is described in detail for
<<cmdhelp_configure_colocation,`colocation`>>.

For more details on how to configure resource sets, see
<<topics_Features_Resourcesets,`Syntax: Resource sets`>>.

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
location <id> <rsc> [<attributes>] {<node_pref>|<rules>}

rsc :: /<rsc-pattern>/
        | { resource_sets }
        | <rsc>

attributes :: role=<role> | resource-discovery=always|never|exclusive

node_pref :: <score>: <node>

rules ::
  rule [id_spec] [$role=<role>] <score>: <expression>
  [rule [id_spec] [$role=<role>] <score>: <expression> ...]

id_spec :: $id=<id> | $id-ref=<id>
score :: <number> | <attribute> | [-]inf
expression :: <simple_exp> [<bool_op> <simple_exp> ...]
bool_op :: or | and
simple_exp :: <attribute> [type:]<binary_op> <value>
          | <unary_op> <attribute>
          | date <date_expr>
type :: string | version | number
binary_op :: lt | gt | lte | gte | eq | ne
unary_op :: defined | not_defined

date_expr :: lt <end>
         | gt <start>
         | in start=<start> end=<end>
         | in start=<start> <duration>
         | spec <date_spec>
duration|date_spec ::
         hours=<value>
         | monthdays=<value>
         | weekdays=<value>
         | yearsdays=<value>
         | months=<value>
         | weeks=<value>
         | years=<value>
         | weekyears=<value>
         | moon=<value>
...............
Examples:
...............
location conn_1 internal_www 100: node1

location conn_1 internal_www \
  rule 50: #uname eq node1 \
  rule pingd: defined pingd

location conn_2 dummy_float \
  rule -inf: not_defined pingd or pingd number:lte 0

# never probe for rsc1 on node1
location no-probe rsc1 resource-discovery=never -inf: node1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_modgroup,modify group]]
==== `modgroup`

Add or remove primitives in a group. The `add` subcommand appends
the new group member by default. Should it go elsewhere, there
are `after` and `before` clauses.

Usage:
...............
modgroup <id> add <id> [after <id>|before <id>]
modgroup <id> remove <id>
...............
Examples:
...............
modgroup share1 add storage2 before share1-fs
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_monitor,add monitor operation to a primitive]]
==== `monitor`

Monitor is by far the most common operation. It is possible to
add it without editing the whole resource. Also, long primitive
definitions may be a bit uncluttered. In order to make this
command as concise as possible, less common operation attributes
are not available. If you need them, then use the `op` part of
the `primitive` command.

Usage:
...............
monitor <rsc>[:<role>] <interval>[:<timeout>]
...............
Example:
...............
monitor apcfence 60m:60s
...............

Note that after executing the command, the monitor operation may
be shown as part of the primitive definition.

[[cmdhelp_configure_ms,define a master-slave resource]]
==== `ms` (`master`)

The `ms` command creates a master/slave resource type. It may contain a
single primitive resource or one group of resources.

Usage:
...............
ms <name> <rsc>
  [description=<description>]
  [meta attr_list]
  [params attr_list]

attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
...............
Example:
...............
ms disk1 drbd1 \
  meta notify=true globally-unique=false
...............

.Note on `id-ref` usage
****************************
Instance or meta attributes (`params` and `meta`) may contain
a reference to another set of attributes. In that case, no other
attributes are allowed. Since attribute sets' ids, though they do
exist, are not shown in the `crm`, it is also possible to
reference an object instead of an attribute set. `crm` will
automatically replace such a reference with the right id:

...............
crm(live)configure# primitive a2 www-2 meta $id-ref=a1
crm(live)configure# show a2
primitive a2 apache \
    meta $id-ref=a1-meta_attributes
    [...]
...............
It is advisable to give meaningful names to attribute sets which
are going to be referenced.
****************************

[[cmdhelp_configure_node,define a cluster node]]
==== `node`

The node command describes a cluster node. Nodes in the CIB are
commonly created automatically by the CRM. Hence, you should not
need to deal with nodes unless you also want to define node
attributes. Note that it is also possible to manage node
attributes at the `node` level.

Usage:
...............
node [$id=<id>] <uname>[:<type>]
  [description=<description>]
  [attributes [$id=<id>] [<score>:] [rule...]
    <param>=<value> [<param>=<value>...]] | $id-ref=<ref>
  [utilization [$id=<id>] [<score>:] [rule...]
    <param>=<value> [<param>=<value>...]] | $id-ref=<ref>

type :: normal | member | ping | remote
...............
Example:
...............
node node1
node big_node attributes memory=64
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_op_defaults,set resource operations defaults]]
==== `op_defaults`

Set defaults for the operations meta attributes.

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
op_defaults [$id=<set_id>] [rule ...] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
op_defaults record-pending=true
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_order,order resources]]
==== `order`

This constraint expresses the order of actions on two resources
or more resources. If there are more than two resources, then the
constraint is called a resource set.

Ordered resource sets have an extra attribute to allow for sets
of resources whose actions may run in parallel. The shell syntax
for such sets is to put resources in parentheses.

If the subsequent resource can start or promote after any one of the
resources in a set has done, enclose the set in brackets (+[+ and +]+).

Sets cannot be nested.

Three strings are reserved to specify a kind of order constraint:
+Mandatory+, +Optional+, and +Serialize+. It is preferred to use
one of these settings instead of score. Previous versions mapped
scores +0+ and +inf+ to keywords +advisory+ and +mandatory+.
That is still valid but deprecated.

For more details on how to configure resource sets, see
<<topics_Features_Resourcesets,`Syntax: Resource sets`>>.

Usage:
...............
order <id> [{kind|<score>}:] first then [symmetrical=<bool>]

order <id> [{kind|<score>}:] resource_sets [symmetrical=<bool>]

kind :: Mandatory | Optional | Serialize

first :: <rsc>[:<action>]

then ::  <rsc>[:<action>]

resource_sets :: resource_set [resource_set ...]

resource_set :: ["["|"("] <rsc>[:<action>] [<rsc>[:<action>] ...] \
                [attributes] ["]"|")"]

attributes :: [require-all=(true|false)] [sequential=(true|false)]

...............
Example:
...............
order o-1 Mandatory: apache:start ip_1
order o-2 Serialize: A ( B C )
order o-3 inf: [ A B ] C
order o-4 first-resource then-resource
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_primitive,define a resource]]
==== `primitive`

The primitive command describes a resource. It may be referenced
only once in group, clone, or master-slave objects. If it's not
referenced, then it is placed as a single resource in the CIB.

Operations may be specified anonymously, as a group or by reference:

* "Anonymous", as a list of +op+ specifications. Use this
  method if you don't need to reference the set of operations
  elsewhere. This is the most common way to define operations.

* If reusing operation sets is desired, use the +operations+ keyword
  along with an id to give the operations set a name. Use the
  +operations+ keyword and an id-ref value set to the id of another
  operations set, to apply the same set of operations to this
  primitive.

Operation attributes which are not recognized are saved as
instance attributes of that operation. A typical example is
+OCF_CHECK_LEVEL+.

For multistate resources, roles are specified as +role=<role>+.

A template may be defined for resources which are of the same
type and which share most of the configuration. See
<<cmdhelp_configure_rsc_template,`rsc_template`>> for more information.

Attributes containing time values, such as the +interval+ attribute on
operations, are configured either as a plain number, which is
interpreted as a time in seconds, or using one of the following
suffixes:

* +s+, +sec+ - time in seconds (same as no suffix)
* +ms+, +msec+ - time in milliseconds
* +us+, +usec+ - time in microseconds
* +m+, +min+ - time in minutes
* +h+, +hr+ - time in hours

Usage:
...............
primitive <rsc> {[<class>:[<provider>:]]<type>|@<template>}
  [description=<description>]
  [[params] attr_list]
  [meta attr_list]
  [utilization attr_list]
  [operations id_spec]
    [op op_type [<attribute>=<value>...] ...]

attr_list :: [$id=<id>] [<score>:] [rule...]
             <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...]] | $id-ref=<id>
id_spec :: $id=<id> | $id-ref=<id>
op_type :: start | stop | monitor
...............
Example:
...............
primitive apcfence stonith:apcsmart \
  params ttydev=/dev/ttyS0 hostlist="node1 node2" \
  op start timeout=60s \
  op monitor interval=30m timeout=60s

primitive www8 apache \
  configfile=/etc/apache/www8.conf \
  operations $id-ref=apache_ops

primitive db0 mysql \
  params config=/etc/mysql/db0.conf \
  op monitor interval=60s \
  op monitor interval=300s OCF_CHECK_LEVEL=10

primitive r0 ocf:linbit:drbd \
  params drbd_resource=r0 \
  op monitor role=Master interval=60s \
  op monitor role=Slave interval=300s

primitive xen0 @vm_scheme1 xmfile=/etc/xen/vm/xen0

primitive mySpecialRsc Special \
  params 3: rule #uname eq node1 interface=eth1 \
  params 2: rule #uname eq node2 interface=eth2 port=8888 \
  params 1: interface=eth0 port=9999

...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_property,set a cluster property]]
==== `property`

Set cluster configuration properties. To list the
available cluster configuration properties, use the
<<cmdhelp_ra_info,`ra info`>> command with +pengine+, +crmd+,
+cib+ and +stonithd+ as arguments.

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
property [<set_id>:] [rule ...] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
property stonith-enabled=true
property rule date spec years=2014 stonith-enabled=false
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_ptest,show cluster actions if changes were committed]]
==== `ptest` (`simulate`)

Show PE (Policy Engine) motions using `ptest(8)` or
`crm_simulate(8)`.

A CIB is constructed using the current user edited configuration
and the status from the running CIB. The resulting CIB is run
through `ptest` (or `crm_simulate`) to show changes which would
happen if the configuration is committed.

The status section may be loaded from another source and modified
using the <<cmdhelp_cibstatus,`cibstatus`>> level commands. In that case, the
`ptest` command will issue a message informing the user that the
Policy Engine graph is not calculated based on the current status
section and therefore won't show what would happen to the
running but some imaginary cluster.

If you have graphviz installed and X11 session, `dotty(1)` is run
to display the changes graphically.

Add a string of +v+ characters to increase verbosity. `ptest`
can also show allocation scores. +utilization+ turns on
information about the remaining capacity of nodes. With the
+actions+ option, `ptest` will print all resource actions.

The `ptest` program has been replaced by `crm_simulate` in newer
Pacemaker versions. In some installations both could be
installed. Use `simulate` to enfore using `crm_simulate`.

Usage:
...............
ptest [nograph] [v...] [scores] [actions] [utilization]
...............
Examples:
...............
ptest scores
ptest vvvvv
simulate actions
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_refresh,refresh from CIB]]
==== `refresh`

Refresh the internal structures from the CIB. All changes made
during this session are lost.

Usage:
...............
refresh
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rename,rename a CIB object]]
==== `rename`

Rename an object. It is recommended to use this command to rename
a resource, because it will take care of updating all related
constraints and a parent resource. Changing ids with the edit
command won't have the same effect.

If you want to rename a resource, it must be in the stopped state.

Usage:
...............
rename <old_id> <new_id>
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_role,define role access rights]]
==== `role`

An ACL role is a set of rules which describe access rights to
CIB. Rules consist of an access right +read+, +write+, or +deny+
and a specification denoting part of the configuration to which
the access right applies. The specification can be an XPath or a
combination of tag and id references. If an attribute is
appended, then the specification applies only to that attribute
of the matching element.

There is a number of shortcuts for XPath specifications. The
+meta+, +params+, and +utilization+ shortcuts reference resource
meta attributes, parameters, and utilization respectively. The
`location` may be used to specify location constraints most of
the time to allow resource `move` and `unmove` commands. The
`property` references cluster properties. The `node` allows
reading node attributes. +nodeattr+ and +nodeutil+ reference node
attributes and node capacity (utilization). The `status` shortcut
references the whole status section of the CIB. Read access to
status is necessary for various monitoring tools such as
`crm_mon(8)` (aka `crm status`).

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
role <role-id> rule [rule ...]

rule :: acl-right cib-spec [attribute:<attribute>]

acl-right :: read | write | deny

cib-spec :: xpath-spec | tag-ref-spec
xpath-spec :: xpath:<xpath> | shortcut
tag-ref-spec :: tag:<tag> | ref:<id> | tag:<tag> ref:<id>

shortcut :: meta:<rsc>[:<attr>]
        params:<rsc>[:<attr>]
        utilization:<rsc>
        location:<rsc>
        property[:<attr>]
        node[:<node>]
        nodeattr[:<attr>]
        nodeutil[:<node>]
        status
...............
Example:
...............
role app1_admin \
    write meta:app1:target-role \
    write meta:app1:is-managed \
    write location:app1 \
    read ref:app1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rsc_defaults,set resource defaults]]
==== `rsc_defaults`

Set defaults for the resource meta attributes.

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
rsc_defaults [<set_id>:] [rule ...] <option>=<value> [<option>=<value> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
rsc_defaults failure-timeout=3m
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rsc_template,define a resource template]]
==== `rsc_template`

The `rsc_template` command creates a resource template. It may be
referenced in primitives. It is used to reduce large
configurations with many similar resources.

Usage:
...............
rsc_template <name> [<class>:[<provider>:]]<type>
  [description=<description>]
  [params attr_list]
  [meta attr_list]
  [utilization attr_list]
  [operations id_spec]
    [op op_type [<attribute>=<value>...] ...]

attr_list :: [$id=<id>] <attr>=<val> [<attr>=<val>...] | $id-ref=<id>
id_spec :: $id=<id> | $id-ref=<id>
op_type :: start | stop | monitor
...............
Example:
...............
rsc_template public_vm Xen \
  op start timeout=300s \
  op stop timeout=300s \
  op monitor interval=30s timeout=60s \
  op migrate_from timeout=600s \
  op migrate_to timeout=600s
primitive xen0 @public_vm \
  params xmfile=/etc/xen/xen0
primitive xen1 @public_vm \
  params xmfile=/etc/xen/xen1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_rsc_ticket,resources ticket dependency]]
==== `rsc_ticket`

This constraint expresses dependency of resources on cluster-wide
attributes, also known as tickets. Tickets are mainly used in
geo-clusters, which consist of multiple sites. A ticket may be
granted to a site, thus allowing resources to run there.

The +loss-policy+ attribute specifies what happens to the
resource (or resources) if the ticket is revoked. The default is
either +stop+ or +demote+ depending on whether a resource is
multi-state.

See also the <<cmdhelp_site_ticket,`site`>> set of commands.

Usage:
...............
rsc_ticket <id> <ticket_id>: <rsc>[:<role>] [<rsc>[:<role>] ...]
  [loss-policy=<loss_policy_action>]

loss_policy_action :: stop | demote | fence | freeze
...............
Example:
...............
rsc_ticket ticket-A_public-ip ticket-A: public-ip
rsc_ticket ticket-A_bigdb ticket-A: bigdb loss-policy=fence
rsc_ticket ticket-B_storage ticket-B: drbd-a:Master drbd-b:Master
...............


[[cmdhelp_configure_rsctest,test resources as currently configured]]
==== `rsctest`

Test resources with current resource configuration. If no nodes
are specified, tests are run on all known nodes.

The order of resources is significant: it is assumed that later
resources depend on earlier ones.

If a resource is multi-state, it is assumed that the role on
which later resources depend is master.

Tests are run sequentially to prevent running the same resource
on two or more nodes. Tests are carried out only if none of the
specified nodes currently run any of the specified resources.
However, it won't verify whether resources run on the other
nodes.

Superuser privileges are obviously required: either run this as
root or setup the `sudoers` file appropriately.

Note that resource testing may take some time.

Usage:
...............
rsctest <rsc_id> [<rsc_id> ...] [<node_id> ...]
...............
Examples:
...............
rsctest my_ip websvc
rsctest websvc nodeB
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_save,save the CIB to a file]]
==== `save`

Save the current configuration to a file. Optionally, as XML. Use
+-+ instead of file name to write the output to `stdout`.

The `save` command accepts the same selection arguments as the `show`
command. See the <<cmdhelp_configure_show,help section>> for `show`
for more details.

Usage:
...............
save [xml] [<id> | type:<type | tag:<tag> |
            related:<obj> | changed ...] <file>
...............
Example:
...............
save myfirstcib.txt
save web-server server-config.txt
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_schema,set or display current CIB RNG schema]]
==== `schema`

CIB's content is validated by a RNG schema. Pacemaker supports
several, depending on version. At least the following schemas are
accepted by `crmsh`:

* +pacemaker-1.0+
* +pacemaker-1.1+
* +pacemaker-1.2+
* +pacemaker-1.3+
* +pacemaker-2.0+

Use this command to display or switch to another RNG schema.

Usage:
...............
schema [<schema>]
...............
Example:
...............
schema pacemaker-1.1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_set,set an attribute value]]
==== `set`

Set the value of a configured attribute. The attribute must
have a value configured previously, and can be an agent
parameter, meta attribute or utilization value.

The first argument to the command is a path to an attribute.
This is a dot-separated sequence beginning with the name of
the resource, and ending with the name of the attribute to
set.

Usage:
...............
set <path> <value>
...............
Examples:
...............
set vip1.ip 192.168.20.5
set vm-a.force_stop 1
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_show,display CIB objects]]
==== `show`

The `show` command displays CIB objects. Without any argument, it
displays all objects in the CIB, but the set of objects displayed by
`show` can be limited to only objects with the given IDs or by using
one or more of the special prefixes described below.

The XML representation for the objects can be displayed by passing
+xml+ as the first argument.

To show one or more specific objects, pass the object IDs as
arguments.

To show all objects of a certain type, use the +type:+ prefix.

To show all objects in a tag, use the +tag:+ prefix.

To show all constraints related to a primitive, use the +related:+ prefix.

To show all modified objects, pass the argument +changed+.

The prefixes can be used together on a single command line. For
example, to show both the tag itself and the objects tagged by it the
following combination can be used: +show tag:my-tag my-tag+.

To refine a selection of objects using multiple modifiers, the keywords
+and+ and +or+ can be used. For example, to select all primitives tagged
+foo+, the following combination can be used:
+show type:primitive and tag:foo+.

Usage:
...............
show [xml] [<id>
           | changed
           | type:<type>
           | tag:<id>

[[cmdhelp_configure_tag,Define resource tags]]
==== `tag`

Define a resource tag. A tag is an id referring to one or more
resources, without implying any constraints between the tagged
resources. This can be useful for grouping conceptually related
resources.

Usage:
...............
tag <tag-name>: <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
tag <tag-name> <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
tag web: p-webserver p-vip
tag ips server-vip admin-vip
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_template,edit and import a configuration from a template]]
==== `template`

The specified template is loaded into the editor. It's up to the
user to make a good CRM configuration out of it. See also the
<<cmdhelp_template,template section>>.

Usage:
...............
template [xml] url
...............
Example:
...............
template two-apaches.txt
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_upgrade,upgrade the CIB]]
==== `upgrade`

Attempts to upgrade the CIB to validate with the current
version. Commonly, this is required if the error
`CIB not supported` occurs. It typically means that the
active CIB version is coming from an older release.

As a safety precaution, the force argument is required if the
+validation-with+ attribute is set to anything other than
+0.6+. Thus in most cases, it is required.

Usage:
...............
upgrade [force]
...............

Example:
...............
upgrade force
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_user,define user access rights]]
==== `user`

Users which normally cannot view or manage cluster configuration
can be allowed access to parts of the CIB. The access is defined
by a set of +read+, +write+, and +deny+ rules as in role
definitions or by referencing roles. The latter is considered
best practice.

For more information on rule expressions, see
<<topics_Syntax_RuleExpressions,Syntax: Rule expressions>>.

Usage:
...............
user <uid> {roles|rules}

roles :: role:<role-ref> [role:<role-ref> ...]
rules :: rule [rule ...]
...............
Example:
...............
user joe \
    role:app1_admin \
    role:read_all
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_validate_all,call agent validate-all for resource]]
==== `validate-all`

Call the `validate-all` action for the resource, if possible.

Limitations:

* The resource agent must implement the `validate-all` action.
* The current user must be root.
* The primitive resource must not use nvpair references.

Usage:
...............
validate-all <rsc>
...............


[[cmdhelp_configure_verify,verify the CIB with crm_verify]]
==== `verify`

Verify the contents of the CIB which would be committed.

Usage:
...............
verify
...............

[[cmdhelp_configure_xml,raw xml]]
==== `xml`

Even though we promissed no xml, it may happen, but hopefully
very very seldom, that an element from the CIB cannot be rendered
in the configuration language. In that case, the element will be
shown as raw xml, prefixed by this command. That element can then
be edited like any other. If the shell finds out that after the
change it can digest it, then it is going to be converted into
the normal configuration language. Otherwise, there is no need to
use `xml` for configuration.

Usage:
...............
xml <xml>
...............

[[cmdhelp_template,edit and import a configuration from a template]]
=== `template` - Import configuration from templates

User may be assisted in the cluster configuration by templates
prepared in advance. Templates consist of a typical ready
configuration which may be edited to suit particular user needs.

This command enters a template level where additional commands
for configuration/template management are available.

[[cmdhelp_template_apply,process and apply the current configuration to the current CIB]]
==== `apply`

Copy the current or given configuration to the current CIB. By
default, the CIB is replaced, unless the method is set to
"update".

Usage:
...............
apply [<method>] [<config>]

method :: replace | update
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_delete,delete a configuration]]
==== `delete`

Remove a configuration. The loaded (active) configuration may be
removed by force.

Usage:
...............
delete <config> [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_edit,edit a configuration]]
==== `edit`

Edit current or given configuration using your favourite editor.

Usage:
...............
edit [<config>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_list,list configurations/templates]]
==== `list`

When called with no argument, lists existing templates and
configurations.

Given the argument +templates+, lists the available templates.

Given the argument +configs+, lists the available configurations.

Usage:
...............
list [templates|configs]
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_load,load a configuration]]
==== `load`

Load an existing configuration. Further `edit`, `show`, and
`apply` commands will refer to this configuration.

Usage:
...............
load <config>
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_new,create a new configuration from templates]]
==== `new`

Create a new configuration from one or more templates. Note that
configurations and templates are kept in different places, so it
is possible to have a configuration name equal a template name.

If you already know which parameters are required, you can set
them directly on the command line.

The parameter name +id+ is set by default to the name of the
configuration.

If no parameters are being set and you don't want a particular name
for your configuration, you can call this command with a template name
as the only parameter. A unique configuration name based on the
template name will be generated.

Usage:
...............
new [<config>] <template> [<template> ...] [params name=value ...]
...............

Example:
...............
new vip virtual-ip
new bigfs ocfs2 params device=/dev/sdx8 directory=/bigfs
new apache
...............

[[cmdhelp_template_show,show the processed configuration]]
==== `show`

Process the current or given configuration and display the result.

Usage:
...............
show [<config>]
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus,CIB status management and editing]]
=== `cibstatus` - CIB status management and editing

The `status` section of the CIB keeps the current status of nodes
and resources. It is modified _only_ on events, i.e. when some
resource operation is run or node status changes. For obvious
reasons, the CRM has no user interface with which it is possible
to affect the status section. From the user's point of view, the
status section is essentially a read-only part of the CIB. The
current status is never even written to disk, though it is
available in the PE (Policy Engine) input files which represent
the history of cluster motions. The current status may be read
using the +cibadmin -Q+ command.

It may sometimes be of interest to see how status changes would
affect the Policy Engine. The set of `cibstatus` level commands
allow the user to load status sections from various sources and
then insert or modify resource operations or change nodes' state.

The effect of those changes may then be observed by running the
<<cmdhelp_configure_ptest,`ptest`>> command at the `configure` level
or `simulate` and `run` commands at this level. The `ptest`
runs with the user edited CIB whereas the latter two commands
run with the CIB which was loaded along with the status section.

The `simulate` and `run` commands as well as all status
modification commands are implemented using `crm_simulate(8)`.

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_load,load the CIB status section]]
==== `load`

Load a status section from a file, a shadow CIB, or the running
cluster. By default, the current (+live+) status section is
modified. Note that if the +live+ status section is modified it
is not going to be updated if the cluster status changes, because
that would overwrite the user changes. To make `crm` drop changes
and resume use of the running cluster status, run +load live+.

All CIB shadow configurations contain the status section which is
a snapshot of the status section taken at the time the shadow was
created. Obviously, this status section doesn't have much to do
with the running cluster status, unless the shadow CIB has just
been created. Therefore, the `ptest` command by default uses the
running cluster status section.

Usage:
...............
load {<file>|shadow:<cib>|live}
...............
Example:
...............
load bug-12299.xml
load shadow:test1
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_node,change node status]]
==== `node`

Change the node status. It is possible to throw a node out of
the cluster, make it a member, or set its state to unclean.

+online+:: Set the +node_state+ `crmd` attribute to +online+
and the +expected+ and +join+ attributes to +member+. The effect
is that the node becomes a cluster member.

+offline+:: Set the +node_state+ `crmd` attribute to +offline+
and the +expected+ attribute to empty. This makes the node
cleanly removed from the cluster.

+unclean+:: Set the +node_state+ `crmd` attribute to +offline+
and the +expected+ attribute to +member+. In this case the node
has unexpectedly disappeared.

Usage:
...............
node <node> {online|offline|unclean}
...............
Example:
...............
node xen-b unclean
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_op,edit outcome of a resource operation]]
==== `op`

Edit the outcome of a resource operation. This way you can
tell CRM that it ran an operation and that the resource agent
returned certain exit code. It is also possible to change the
operation's status. In case the operation status is set to
something other than +done+, the exit code is effectively
ignored.

Usage:
...............
op <operation> <resource> <exit_code> [<op_status>] [<node>]

operation :: probe | monitor[:<n>] | start | stop |
   promote | demote | notify | migrate_to | migrate_from
exit_code :: <rc> | success | generic | args |
   unimplemented | perm | installed | configured | not_running |
   master | failed_master
op_status :: pending | done | cancelled | timeout | notsupported | error

n :: the monitor interval in seconds; if omitted, the first
   recurring operation is referenced
rc :: numeric exit code in range 0..9
...............
Example:
...............
op start d1 xen-b generic
op start d1 xen-b 1
op monitor d1 xen-b not_running
op stop d1 xen-b 0 timeout
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_origin,display origin of the CIB status section]]
==== `origin`

Show the origin of the status section currently in use. This
essentially shows the latest `load` argument.

Usage:
...............
origin
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_quorum,set the quorum]]
==== `quorum`

Set the quorum value.

Usage:
...............
quorum <bool>
...............
Example:
...............
quorum false
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_run,run policy engine]]
==== `run`

Run the policy engine with the edited status section.

Add a string of +v+ characters to increase verbosity. Specify
+scores+ to see allocation scores also. +utilization+ turns on
information about the remaining capacity of nodes.

If you have graphviz installed and X11 session, `dotty(1)` is run
to display the changes graphically.

Usage:
...............
run [nograph] [v...] [scores] [utilization]
...............
Example:
...............
run
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_save,save the CIB status section]]
==== `save`

The current internal status section with whatever modifications
were performed can be saved to a file or shadow CIB.

If the file exists and contains a complete CIB, only the status
section is going to be replaced and the rest of the CIB will
remain intact. Otherwise, the current user edited configuration
is saved along with the status section.

Note that all modifications are saved in the source file as soon
as they are run.

Usage:
...............
save [<file>|shadow:<cib>]
...............
Example:
...............
save bug-12299.xml
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_show,show CIB status section]]
==== `show`

Show the current status section in the XML format. Brace yourself
for some unreadable output. Add +changed+ option to get a human
readable output of all changes.

Usage:
...............
show [changed]
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_simulate,simulate cluster transition]]
==== `simulate`

Run the policy engine with the edited status section and simulate
the transition.

Add a string of +v+ characters to increase verbosity. Specify
+scores+ to see allocation scores also. +utilization+ turns on
information about the remaining capacity of nodes.

If you have graphviz installed and X11 session, `dotty(1)` is run
to display the changes graphically.

Usage:
...............
simulate [nograph] [v...] [scores] [utilization]
...............
Example:
...............
simulate
...............

[[cmdhelp_cibstatus_ticket,manage tickets]]
==== `ticket`

Modify the ticket status. Tickets can be granted and revoked.
Granted tickets could be activated or put in standby.

Usage:
...............
ticket <ticket> {grant|revoke|activate|standby}
...............
Example:
...............
ticket ticketA grant
...............

[[cmdhelp_assist,Configuration assistant]]
=== `assist` - Configuration assistant

The `assist` sublevel is a collection of helper
commands that create or modify resources and
constraints, to simplify the creation of certain
configurations.

For more information on individual commands, see
the help text for those commands.

[[cmdhelp_assist_template,Create template for primitives]]
==== `template`

This command takes a list of primitives as argument, and creates a new
`rsc_template` for these primitives. It can only do this if the
primitives do not already share a template and are of the same type.

Usage:
........
template primitive-1 primitive-2 primitive-3
........

[[cmdhelp_assist_weak-bond,Create a weak bond between resources]]
==== `weak-bond`

A colocation between a group of resources says that the resources
should be located together, but it also means that those resources are
dependent on each other. If one of the resources fails, the others
will be restarted.

If this is not desired, it is possible to circumvent: By placing the
resources in a non-sequential set and colocating the set with a dummy
resource which is not monitored, the resources will be placed together
but will have no further dependency on each other.

This command creates both the constraint and the dummy resource needed
for such a colocation.

Usage:
........
weak-bond resource-1 resource-2
........

[[cmdhelp_maintenance,Maintenance mode commands]]
=== `maintenance` - Maintenance mode commands

Maintenance mode commands are commands that manipulate resources
directly without going through the cluster infrastructure. Therefore,
it is essential to ensure that the cluster does not attempt to monitor
or manipulate the resources while these commands are being executed.

To ensure this, these commands require that maintenance mode is set
either for the particular resource, or for the whole cluster.

[[cmdhelp_maintenance_action,Invoke a resource action]]
==== `action`

Invokes the given action for the resource. This is
done directly via the resource agent, so the command must
be issued while the cluster or the resource is in 
maintenance mode.

Unless the action is `start` or `monitor`, the action must be invoked
on the same node as where the resource is running. If the resource is
running on multiple nodes, the command will fail.

To use SSH for executing resource actions on multiple nodes, append
`ssh` after the action name. This requires SSH access to be configured
between the nodes and the parallax python package to be installed.

Usage:
...............
action <rsc> <action>
action <rsc> <action> ssh
...............
Example:
...............
action webserver reload
action webserver monitor ssh
...............

[[cmdhelp_maintenance_off,Disable maintenance mode]]
==== `off`

Disables maintenances mode, either for the whole cluster
or for the given resource.

Usage:
...............
off
off <rsc>
...............
Example:
...............
off rsc1
...............

[[cmdhelp_maintenance_on,Enable maintenance mode]]
==== `on`

Enables maintenances mode, either for the whole cluster
or for the given resource.

Usage:
...............
on
on <rsc>
...............
Example:
...............
on rsc1
...............

[[cmdhelp_history,Cluster history]]
=== `history` - Cluster history

Examining Pacemaker's history is a particularly involved task. The
number of subsystems to be considered, the complexity of the
configuration, and the set of various information sources, most of
which are not exactly human readable, keep analyzing resource or node
problems accessible to only the most knowledgeable. Or, depending on
the point of view, to the most persistent. The following set of
commands has been devised in hope to make cluster history more
accessible.

Of course, looking at _all_ history could be time consuming regardless
of how good the tools at hand are. Therefore, one should first say
which period he or she wants to analyze. If not otherwise specified,
the last hour is considered. Logs and other relevant information is
collected using `crm report`. Since this process takes some time and
we always need fresh logs, information is refreshed in a much faster
way using the python parallax module. If +python-parallax+ is not
found on the system, examining a live cluster is still possible --
though not as comfortable.

Apart from examining a live cluster, events may be retrieved from a
report generated by `crm report` (see also the +-H+ option). In that
case we assume that the period stretching the whole report needs to be
investigated. Of course, it is still possible to further reduce the
time range.

If you have discovered an issue that you want to show someone else,
you can use the `session pack` command to save the current session as
a tarball, similar to those generated by `crm report`.

In order to minimize the size of the tarball, and to make it easier
for others to find the interesting events, it is recommended to limit
the time frame which the saved session covers. This can be done using
the `timeframe` command (example below).

It is also possible to name the saved session using the `session save`
command.

Example:
...............
crm(live)history# limit "Jul 18 12:00" "Jul 18 12:30"
crm(live)history# session save strange_restart
crm(live)history# session pack
Report saved in .../strange_restart.tar.bz2
crm(live)history#
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_detail,set the level of detail shown]]
==== `detail`

How much detail to show from the logs. Valid detail levels are either
`0` or `1`, where `1` is the highest detail level. The default detail
level is `0`.

Usage:
...............
detail <detail_level>

detail_level :: small integer (defaults to 0)
...............
Example:
...............
detail 1
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_diff,cluster states/transitions difference]]
==== `diff`

A transition represents a change in cluster configuration or
state. Use `diff` to see what has changed between two
transitions.

If you want to specify the current cluster configuration and
status, use the string +live+.

Normally, the first transition specified should be the one which
is older, but we are not going to enforce that.

Note that a single configuration update may result in more than
one transition.

Usage:
...............
diff <pe> <pe> [status] [html]

pe :: <number>|<index>|<file>|live
...............
Examples:
...............
diff 2066 2067
diff pe-input-2080.bz2 live status
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_events,Show events in log]]
==== `events`

By analysing the log output and looking for particular
patterns, the `events` command helps sifting through
the logs to find when particular events like resources
changing state or node failure may have occurred.

This can be used to generate a combined list of events
from all nodes.

Usage:
...............
events
...............

Example:
...............
events
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_exclude,exclude log messages]]
==== `exclude`

If a log is infested with irrelevant messages, those messages may
be excluded by specifying a regular expression. The regular
expressions used are Python extended. This command is additive.
To drop all regular expressions, use +exclude clear+. Run
`exclude` only to see the current list of regular expressions.
Excludes are saved along with the history sessions.

Usage:
...............
exclude [<regex>|clear]
...............
Example:
...............
exclude kernel.*ocfs2
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_graph,generate a directed graph from the PE file]]
==== `graph`

Create a graphviz graphical layout from the PE file (the
transition). Every transition contains the cluster configuration
which was active at the time. See also <<cmdhelp_configure_graph,generate a directed graph
from configuration>>.

Usage:
...............
graph <pe> [<gtype> [<file> [<img_format>]]]

gtype :: dot
img_format :: `dot` output format (see the +-T+ option)
...............
Example:
...............
graph -1
graph 322 dot clu1.conf.dot
graph 322 dot clu1.conf.svg svg
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_info,Cluster information summary]]
==== `info`

The `info` command provides a summary of the information source, which
can be either a live cluster snapshot or a previously generated
report.

Usage:
...............
info
...............
Example:
...............
info
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_latest,show latest news from the cluster]]
==== `latest`

The `latest` command shows a bit of recent history, more
precisely whatever happened since the last cluster change (the
latest transition). If the transition is running, the shell will
first wait until it finishes.

Usage:
...............
latest
...............
Example:
...............
latest
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_limit,limit timeframe to be examined]]
==== `limit` (`timeframe`)

This command can be used to modify the time span to examine. All
history commands look at events within a certain time span.

For the `live` source, the default time span is the _last hour_.

There is no time span limit for the `hb_report` source.

The time period is parsed by the `dateutil` python module. It
covers a wide range of date formats. For instance:

- 3:00          (today at 3am)
- 15:00         (today at 3pm)
- 2010/9/1 2pm  (September 1st 2010 at 2pm)

For more examples of valid time/date statements, please refer to the
`python-dateutil` documentation:

- https://dateutil.readthedocs.org/[dateutil.readthedocs.org]

If the dateutil module is not available, then the time is parsed using
strptime and only the kind as printed by `date(1)` is allowed:

- Tue Sep 15 20:46:27 CEST 2010

Usage:
...............
limit [<from_time>] [<to_time>]
...............
Examples:
...............
limit 10:15
limit 15h22m 16h
limit "Sun 5 20:46" "Sun 5 22:00"
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_log,log content]]
==== `log`

Show messages logged on one or more nodes. Leaving out a node
name produces combined logs of all nodes. Messages are sorted by
time and, if the terminal emulations supports it, displayed in
different colours depending on the node to allow for easier
reading.

The sorting key is the timestamp as written by syslog which
normally has the maximum resolution of one second. Obviously,
messages generated by events which share the same timestamp may
not be sorted in the same way as they happened. Such close events
may actually happen fairly often.

Usage:
...............
log [<node> [<node> ...] ]
...............
Example:
...............
log node-a
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_node,node events]]
==== `node`

Show important events that happened on a node. Important events
are node lost and join, standby and online, and fence. Use either
node names or extended regular expressions.

Usage:
...............
node <node> [<node> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
node node1
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_peinputs,list or get PE input files]]
==== `peinputs`

Every event in the cluster results in generating one or more
Policy Engine (PE) files. These files describe future motions of
resources. The files are listed as full paths in the current
report directory. Add +v+ to also see the creation time stamps.

Usage:
...............
peinputs [{<range>|<number>} ...] [v]

range :: <n1>:<n2>
...............
Example:
...............
peinputs
peinputs 440:444 446
peinputs v
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_refresh,refresh live report]]
==== `refresh`

This command makes sense only for the +live+ source and makes
`crm` collect the latest logs and other relevant information from
the logs. If you want to make a completely new report, specify
+force+.

Usage:
...............
refresh [force]
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_resource,resource events]]
==== `resource`

Show actions and any failures that happened on all specified
resources on all nodes. Normally, one gives resource names as
arguments, but it is also possible to use extended regular
expressions. Note that neither groups nor clones or master/slave
names are ever logged. The resource command is going to expand
all of these appropriately, so that clone instances or resources
which are part of a group are shown.

Usage:
...............
resource <rsc> [<rsc> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
resource bigdb public_ip
resource my_.*_db2
resource ping_clone
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_session,manage history sessions]]
==== `session`

Sometimes you may want to get back to examining a particular
history period or bug report. In order to make that easier, the
current settings can be saved and later retrieved.

If the current history being examined is coming from a live
cluster the logs, PE inputs, and other files are saved too,
because they may disappear from nodes. For the existing reports
coming from `hb_report`, only the directory location is saved
(not to waste space).

A history session may also be packed into a tarball which can
then be sent to support.

Leave out subcommand to see the current session.

Usage:
...............
session [{save|load|delete} <name> | pack [<name>] | update | list]
...............
Examples:
...............
session save bnc966622
session load rsclost-2
session list
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_setnodes,set the list of cluster nodes]]
==== `setnodes`

In case the host this program runs on is not part of the cluster,
it is necessary to set the list of nodes.

Usage:
...............
setnodes node <node> [<node> ...]
...............
Example:
...............
setnodes node_a node_b
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_show,show status or configuration of the PE input file]]
==== `show`

Every transition is saved as a PE file. Use this command to
render that PE file either as configuration or status. The
configuration output is the same as `crm configure show`.

Usage:
...............
show <pe> [status]

pe :: <number>|<index>|<file>|live
...............
Examples:
...............
show 2066
show pe-input-2080.bz2 status
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_source,set source to be examined]]
==== `source`

Events to be examined can come from the current cluster or from a
`hb_report` report. This command sets the source. `source live`
sets source to the running cluster and system logs. If no source
is specified, the current source information is printed.

In case a report source is specified as a file reference, the file
is going to be unpacked in place where it resides. This directory
is not removed on exit.

Usage:
...............
source [<dir>|<file>|live]
...............
Examples:
...............
source live
source /tmp/customer_case_22.tar.bz2
source /tmp/customer_case_22
source
...............

[[cmdhelp_history_transition,show transition]]
==== `transition`

This command will print actions planned by the PE and run
graphviz (`dotty`) to display a graphical representation of the
transition. Of course, for the latter an X11 session is required.
This command invokes `ptest(8)` in background.

The +showdot+ subcommand runs graphviz (`dotty`) to display a
graphical representation of the +.dot+ file which has been
included in the report. Essentially, it shows the calculation
produced by `pengine` which is installed on the node where the
report was produced. In optimal case this output should not
differ from the one produced by the locally installed `pengine`.

The `log` subcommand shows the full log for the duration of the
transition.

A transition can also be saved to a CIB shadow for further
analysis or use with `cib` or `configure` commands (use the
`save` subcommand). The shadow file name defaults to the name of
the PE input file.

If the PE input file number is not provided, it defaults to the
last one, i.e. the last transition. The last transition can also
be referenced with number 0. If the number is negative, then the
corresponding transition relative to the last one is chosen.

If there are warning and error PE input files or different nodes
were the DC in the observed timeframe, it may happen that PE
input file numbers collide. In that case provide some unique part
of the path to the file.

After the `ptest` output, logs about events that happened during
the transition are printed.

The `tags` subcommand scans the logs for the transition and return a
list of key events during that transition. For example, the tag
+error+ will be returned if there are any errors logged during the
transition.

Usage:

[[cmdhelp_history_transitions,List transitions]]
==== `transitions`

A transition represents a change in cluster configuration or
state. This command lists the transitions in the current timeframe.

Usage:
...............
transitions
...............
Example:
...............
transitions
...............


[[cmdhelp_history_wdiff,cluster states/transitions difference]]
==== `wdiff`

A transition represents a change in cluster configuration or
state. Use `wdiff` to see what has changed between two
transitions as word differences on a line-by-line basis.

If you want to specify the current cluster configuration and
status, use the string +live+.

Normally, the first transition specified should be the one which
is older, but we are not going to enforce that.

Note that a single configuration update may result in more than
one transition.

Usage:
...............
wdiff <pe> <pe> [status]

pe :: <number>|<index>|<file>|live
...............
Examples:
...............
wdiff 2066 2067
wdiff pe-input-2080.bz2 live status
...............

[[cmdhelp_root_report,Create cluster status report]]
=== `report`

Interface to a tool for creating a cluster report. A report is an
archive containing log files, configuration files, system information
and other relevant data for a given time period. This is a useful tool
for collecting data to attach to bug reports, or for detecting the
root cause of errors resulting in resource failover, for example.

See `crmsh_hb_report(8)` for more details on arguments,
or call `crm report -h`

Usage:
...............
report -f {time|"cts:"testnum} [-t time] [-u user] [-l file]
       [-n nodes] [-E files] [-p patt] [-L patt] [-e prog]
       [-MSDZAVsvhd] [dest]
...............

Examples:
...............
report -f 2pm report_1
report -f "2007/9/5 12:30" -t "2007/9/5 14:00" report_2
report -f 1:00 -t 3:00 -l /var/log/cluster/ha-debug report_3
report -f "09sep07 2:00" -u hbadmin report_4
report -f 18:00 -p "usern.*" -p "admin.*" report_5
report -f cts:133 ctstest_133
...............

=== `end` (`cd`, `up`)

The `end` command ends the current level and the user moves to
the parent level. This command is available everywhere.

Usage:
...............
end
...............

=== `help`

The `help` command prints help for the current level or for the
specified topic (command). This command is available everywhere.

Usage:
...............
help [<topic>]
...............

=== `quit` (`exit`, `bye`)

Leave the program.

BUGS
----
Even though all sensible configurations (and most of those that
are not) are going to be supported by the crm shell, I suspect
that it may still happen that certain XML constructs may confuse
the tool. When that happens, please file a bug report.

The crm shell will not try to update the objects it does not
understand. Of course, it is always possible to edit such objects
in the XML format.
